can be compiled for the whole of hidia   is  available in detail  These provincial and state  volumes will be found to deal in particular with points which I have been able only  and the method I have folhived for the most part has been to examine for myself the figures for India as a whole and then to turn to the provincial reports to point a moral or adorn the tale  hut the  inclusions formed and the opinions expressed to treat in general   are my own   This India volume consists of five parts   i  my report  together mth that of the actuary  Mr  L  S  Vaidyanathan    ii  the statistical

latter volumes being intended pritnarily for departmental use   In submitting it  it is my fortunate  duty to bring formally to your notice the able series of the 1931 Census Reports already mentioned  which are numbered indeed after this volume  but have appeared before it   I have therefore the honour to recommend with confidence to your perusal not  this report but the other twenty seven  and to

Report I find it incumbent on me to depart from precedent and to begin with acknowledgments  first of all  as is fit  to the people of India themselves whose good sense  good citizenship and general co operation made the taking of the census possible  but most of all perhaps to that great body of some two million unpaid enumerators by whom the census was actually taken and without whom it could not have been taken  many of whom were out of pocket by the taking and many of whom carried out their work tmder circumstances of The greatest credit is due and general unpopularity  to them  and that  and a sanad of printed paper  is the only reward that most of them have had  The taking of the pecennial census in India involves the co oper^ion of more than one sixth of the world’s population over an area of nearly tw f‘ million square miles in a combined response to organised enquiry  and the expense would be prohibitive if all the services rendered were paid  Moreover enumerators’ duties were often as onerous physically as they frequently were morally  While city enumerators had generally to take larger blocks than usual since enumerators were harder to come by  those in rural areas often had to cover long dist inces   in Baluchistan the average enumerator had a block of 836 square miles  in the was often a  dllage tribal areas 1 460  in which to find his fifty houses  as a moving encampment of two or three tents with an average area of 36 square miles opposition  interference  ‘  to  ’  itself   Acknowledgments are due likewise to the other links in the chain of Supervisors  Charge Superintendents  District Census Officers  District Magistrates are all part of the necessary machinery and no whit less essential than the enumerator  and in their case the census came as an extra a piece of gratuitous and troublesome overtime work added to their usual duties in many places already onerous and trying above the ordinary by reason of political For this census like that of 1921 had the misfortune to coincide with agitation  a wave of non co operation  and the march of Mr  Gandhi and his contrabandistas to invest the salt pans of Dharasana synchronized with the opening of census The blessing which he gave to the census at the last minute in 1921 operations  was this time wanting  and  though he himself is not known to have issued any advice to boycott the census  it seemed good to some other Congress leaders to do so  as  although they do not seem to have regarded a census as objectionable in itself  the opportunity for harassing government seemed too good to be missed  and January 11th  1931  was notified by the Congress Committee to be observed as Census Boycott Sunday  This boycott was not  however  taken up with any real enthusiasm and  except in the Gujarat cities of Ahmadabad  Broach and Surat and some smaller municipalities like Ghatkopar and Villaparle  had very little but the petty annoyances  resigiiations ultimate effect on the taking of the census with the preparations for final enumeration very greatly interferences and responsibilities the and the anxieties of local officers in charge work  the increased organisation         census work  including as they did not only revenue officers of all grades and  ’illage schoolmasters but police  magistrates  paid and honorary  railway officials  forest officers  port officers  ministerial officers in government olticcs  municipal officers and many others  On the other hand no less trouble was caused in some places by an excess of the zeal on the part of all parties to register as many adherents as possible in view of the possibility of a communal This was particularly the case in franchise based on the census returns  the Punjab  where the exterior castes  badgered first by one party then by another to return themselves as Sikhs  Hindus or Muslims as the case might be  labelled themselves Ad Dharnii  or adherents of the original religion  and so added So high did feeling to the number of religions returned in the census schedules  run over the return of religion in the Pimjab that disputes as to whether a man was Ad Dharmi or Sikh led to a number of affrays and at least to one homicide  Politics were also troublesome in the borders of Orissa where a pau Oriya propaganda  carried on to an extent calculated to frustrate its own purposes  engendered a corresponding counter propaganda  all detrimental to census taking  Special measures were needed in Madras and much additional work caused to the Superintendent of that province and in a less degree also to the Superintendents of of  M22CC  «  \fX  INTRODUCTION   Bengal  Bihar and Orissa and the Central Provinces  Other provinces experienced the usual difficulties that attend census taking in India  In one the Bhils for instance would not have their houses numbered on superstitious grounds  while in Burma householders objected on artistic grounds  In the Shan States the thirteenth and last survivor of a pre annexation raid happened to occupy the thirteenth house in a block  As the enumerator inconsiderately refused to rearrange the numbers  he decided that his was up indeed  went forth into the jungle and committed harakiri  In less law abiding places the disposition was rather towards disembowelling the enumerator than the enumerated  while the effacing of census numbers was a minor difficulty that was particularly troublesome in 1931  Here and there wild beasts interfered instead of wild men  and the Administrator of Bastar State  when inspecting census work on the night itself  was attacked by a tiger  which sprang on to the bonnet of his car  but finding the pace and the radiator too hot for liim failed to make an end either of the inspector or his inspection   A  Difficulties notwithstanding  the census was taken at the appointed time and a complete return was received from all places except Ahmadabad in Gujarat  The returns for some other towns in Gujarat  e g   Broach and Surat  were probably defective  but  as received from the municipalities concerned  were ostensibly correct  In the case of Ahmadabad the census was not completed and the number actually enumerated was estimated to be some seventy  five to seventy six thousand short of the real total according to the census since taken by the Ahmadabad Municipality itself the deficiency was nearly the double of my estimate  In Burma a rebellion broke out between the preliminary and the final enumeration  It interfered with the latter in at least one district but with the former hardly at all  In the Census Abstract published for Parliament I based my estimates of the error caused in the census enumeration by Congress activities on the very carefully estimated error worked out by the Census Superintendent of Bombay for that province which came to  04 per cent   this I doubled for the whole of India arriving at a maximum deficiency of 085 per cent  in the Indian figures  If the Ahmadabad Municipality return be accepted and the deficiency be re calculated accordingly the error still works out at only 1 per cent  for the total population of India  This of course refers to any deficiency caused by the clash of pohtics with the census  Other inaccuracies  whatever the amount  are likely to be fairly constant from census to census the error in the numerical count has been put at a maximum of one per mille and is probably less  The Census Commissioner in 1921 estimated the percentage of error in recording sex and religion at about one per cent  I doubt myself if it is nearly as high as this  but otherwise his estimates probably hold good Owing to the Sarda Act however there has been a definite of this census also  decrease of accuracy in the record of civil condition  and I estimate the error in this respect to be not less than  5 per cent  and probably higher  Fortunately it seems possible to allocate with safety at least the greater part of this error to deliberately inaccurate returns of unmarried instead of married ’ for girls married during 1931 in contravention of the age limits imposed by the Marriage Restraint Act  Error in classification after the return has been made is quite a different thing from error in record and it is extremely difficult to form any estimate of its extent  The entries in the schedules are copied on to slips  omitting the block  circle and charge numbers and of course the personal names  and are then sorted into sets of labelled pigeon holes and counted for the figures which constitute the tables  Different colours are used for different religions and each slip is stamped or printed with a symbol to denote sex  These symbols in 1931 were amplified by hand to signify civil condition  It was found quicker to add to the symbol than to have previously marked symbols from which the correct one had to be selected  a course which involved a choice of six according to sex and civil condition for each individual Probably  also the practice of altering by hand involves less error than slip  that of selection when the tendency’ will be for the copyist  who must turn out a minimum number of slips and is paid in part at any rate by outturn  to fill up the wrong slip rather than to waste time by changing it when ^vrongly selected  In any case there is room for error in slip copying and for error again in sorting  though careful supervision at both stages may keep it down to a very small margin  A certain difficulty  and anomaly  was also introduced into tabulation by the fact that the Burma figures were tabulated on a different system from that followed in India proper  The method of tabulating by’ religion has never been foimd very  suitable in Burma and on this occasion was abandoned for tabulation by race in the interests    •  •        ‘  ’  ‘  \fINTRODUCTION   XI  of that province  but at the cost of some inconsistencies in the presentation of the  India figures   This digression on error has led me aside before making my acknowledgments to the census officers of provinces and states  of whom a list will be found in Chapter I  It seemed to me that their work as a whole was admirable  Several had special difficulties Captain Mallam in the North West Frontier Province   VIr  Turner in the United Provinces  Mr  Porter in Bengal and hlr  Shoobert in the Central Provinces  all experienced difficulties in organising their enumeration on account of political agitation and Khan Sahib Ahmad Hasan Khan in the Punjab had his trouble when the actual enumeration took place even in Delhi his enumerators found their house numbers obliterated and their movements obstructed  Mr  Draeup in Bombay had to contend with the most difficult and troublesome Bombay has a situations of all on account of the anti census campaign in Gujarat  bad reputation for breaking the health of her Census Superintendents  The first Superintendent in 1911 broke dowm after the enumeration was over and the earl   death of the 1921 Superintendent must be imputed at any rate in part to the strain of that census  Mr  Draeup managed to carry on till the compilation was almost finished and his reports begun  for the Bombay post involved writing two additional reports  one for the Western India States Agency  the other for the Bombay Cities   but his health could not stand it he suffered the chagrin of being beaten on the post  and had to make over his material to Mr  Sorley  More provinces than usual were handicapped by similar changes  In Bihar and Orissa his work hir  Scotland’s health broke down very early in the operations and was taken over by Mr  Lacey who had a very uphill task indeed to get his census to synchronize  as he came in at a critical stage which found him unfamiliar with the early part of the work and at which the preparations for enumeration had fallen In the sadly into arrears as the inevitable result of Mr  Scotland’s ill health  till lasted like hlr  Draeup his report North West Frontier Province Captain Mallam once from the earlier stages he was more than taken away was part veritten at these diversions would juobably for administrative ends and but for his census work have finished single handed as it was  Mr  Dundas had like Mr  Sorlev the difficult task of vTiting a report on a census of which he had seen nothing but the materials collected in the course of operations in which he had taken no   arf at all  Provinces and Berar was likewise hampered by being IMi’  Shoobert in the Central abstracted from his census work for admini strative necessities for an inconvctienrly long period at an early  stage of the operations a id was delayed by illness towarils Eai Bahadur Anant Ram in Kashmir had the disadva ntage of not their close  having been in charge of the census from the start of operations and Khan Bahadur Gul Muhammad Khan in Baluchista n was taken awav before he had finished to be Wazir i Azam of Kalat State and had to write his report while performi ig the onerous duties of his vizierate  Colonel Cole with Rajpntana and AjinorAIerwara  Mr  Porter with Bengal and the City of Calcutta and Khan Sahib Ahmad Hasan Khan with the Punjab and Delhi all had two Reports to vuite insirea I of one                 Special difficulties were ex ierienced in  Madras and in a lesser degree in As sam and also in Bihar and Orissa and more or less in all provinces as a result of the clia ige in system  which actually took place in 1921 but the full effects of which were not experienced until this census  by which all costs were made debitable to tlie  Central Governments  The local expenses of enumeration  including the travelling allowances of all local officers doing census work in addition to their ordinarv duties  and including stationery  stamps and so forth required in mofussil operations  had all been charged hitherto to the expenses of general administration  much tlie most convenient and economical way of dealing with small items extremely difficult to disentangle from others where no separate organisation existed and owing to their being merged in general administration no separate record of the expe nditure In 1931 the operations were carried out precisely as before was extant  and the methods used b   local officers at previous censuses were used again  It was not till afterwards that it was discovered that serious liabilities had been incurred in the matter of travelling allowances to meet which no provision District Officers had little enou ^h time to had been made in budgetting  any case  and the general tendency was in many in spare for the census that was a central charge  let the central position this the cases to take    authorities  see to  it   Moreover   many of the claims were submitted at a date  \fINTRODUCTION   xii  which though admissible for ordinary audit purposes was so long after the journeys had taken place that any check of the claim was made extremely difficult  Mr  Yeatts in Madras received no fewer than 26 000 unanticipated bills for travelling allowances amounting in all to approximately Ks  3 00 000  many of them claims received during 1932 for journeys undertaken in 1931  Many of these bills contained claims relating to a whole charge or even taluk  and the actual number of personal claims involved was greatly in excess  of course  of the mere total of By subjecting each bill to the strictest personal scrutiny in the hght of the bills  expenses probably incurred Mr  Yeatts was able to reduce the total actually actual Es  paid to 1 30 000  but it was only by ruthlessly cutting down the claims to the amount by which claimants were likely to have been actually out of pocket  a course of action only made possible by the fact that Mr  Y eatts himself had never dravTL more than his actual out of pocket expenses when touring  whatever the Both he and Mr  Mullan in Assam must rules allowed him to draw above that  have incurred no little odium in the course of their pruning of travelling allowance bills for the extent and nature of which they were in no way to blame  as they had not even been in a position to prepare their own budgets  since the provincial budgets for the year of enumeration were all prepared by local governments before superintendents took over charge  and there was in any case no separate record of the very considerable sums spent in this way from provincial revenues in 1921  It was another of the misfortunes of the 1931 census that it coincided with a  and a period of economic depression which made the most rigorous economy necessary and which left me no choice but to cut all expenditure as fine fall in revenue  my  Census Superintendents unremittingly in an attempt as possible and to goad Their responses were loyal and whole hearted  to finish sooner and spencl less  and in almost every province the actual cost of the census per head censused has been appreciably reduced  if those items be excluded which never appeared These items not only included the travelling allowance in the accounts of 1921  of local officers  previously debited to general administration and the provincial revenues  as well as stamps  stationery and other items used in district offices and similarly debited  but also included all pay of officers whether Provincial or Imperial who were deputed to the Census Department  as well as their leave pay earned during their census service  j assage contributions and so forth  In some cases the budget of this  census has even been debited with the leave pay of officers who served the de  artment in 1921 or earlier but not in 1931 at all  Wages had all increased since 1921 and the cost of printing to the census has been enormously enhanced  in some cases by two hundred per cent  or more  as the result of a change in the method of costing  Under the old method the overhead charges were not debited at all to the census when the   rinting was done  as most of it is  in Grovernment It will be seen at once therefore that a very large part of the increase presses  in the gross cost of the census  approximately Rs  48 76 000 in 1931 against Es  40 00 000 in 1921  is an increase on paper only  As nearly as can be reckoned the actual net expenditure incurred for the 1931 census which is comparable with the expenditure on that of 1921  excluding items not then charged to the census budget  amounts to Rs  40 13 000  and when this is reduced to the cost per thousand of persons censused  which is the only fair standard of comparison  the 1931 census comes quite creditably through the test having cost only Rs  12 ’8 per thousand persons censused as compared to Rs  14 per thousand in 1921  The cost of the census of England and Yv ales in 1921 was £9 5 6 per thousand  about Rs  124 of Indian exclusive of the expenditure on printing  stationery  maps  etc ”  the money  exclusion of which from the costs of the Indian census would reduce the cost per thousand to Rs  13  3  while the census of Northern Ireland in 1926 cost over £15 6 4 per thousand inclusive of printing  etc   that is Rs  202 per thousand as compared to India s Rs  14 inclusive  The census of India therefore is not only by far the most extensive census operation in the world but  besides being one of the quickest  it is probably the cheapest  Even so the cost is no inconsiderable item at a time when the difficulty of restricting expenditure to the limits imposed by dwindling revenue is so difficult that many countries decided to dispense entirely and it was therefore necessary to exercise a very with the census due in 1931 parsimonious economy  and I owe to all Census Superintendents and likewise to their administrative  office and compiling staff not only my acknowledgments for their ungrudging co operation but also my apologies for driving them at a pace    \fIKTRODUCTIOX   Xlll  whicli has admitted of closing down the department some seven months earlier than usual  and for cutting down their estimates to the finest possible margin  compatible with reasonable efficiency  The work of a provincial census officer in India  ail done against time  against expenditure  and without holidays  is far from the pleasant occupation which its interest would make it were the need for speed and eccr omy less exacting   In spite of this there has been no falhng off in the quality of the reports which well maintain the high standard set by past series  The Andamans and Nicobars  Report reflects Mr  Bonington’s lifelong acquaintance with the forests of those islands and their shy  httle known inhabitants Colonel Cole brought to the Eajputana volume a knowledge of the Rajputs and their clans acquired not only regimentally but in the course of several years as Recruiting Officer for Rajput battalions he also showed a commendable despatch and but for his press would have finished even earlier than he did  The other authors of British India Reports are all executive officers in the Imperial or Provincial services and the outlook of the settlement officer is conspicuous among them throughout the series  from Mr  Mullan s lively volume on Assam  also one of the first to be published  to Mr  Turner’s exceptionally full and detailed report on the United Provinces  Their several qualities may frequently be inferred from the excerpts given frecdy in this volume  and where all have reached a high standard it would seem invidious to discriminate  The reports of ilessrs  Bonington  Shoobert and Lacey all contain interesting ethnographical material Mr  A^eatts’ particularly well writien volume is noticeable for his treatment of infirmities  and Mr  Porter s for a neve attack upon the population problem and for an interesting account of the processes of certain decaying rural industries  In Burma and in Bombay J essrs  Bennison and hiorley have brought to the census the experience gained in the study of social and economic questions  and Khan Sahib Ahmad Hasan Khan has opened tlie volume on Delhi           Among the mentioned  as also Agencies been States and the Eajputana volume has already Messrs  Dracup and Sorley’s on the  Western India States  another new addition to the series  while iiir  Venkatachar has filled in somewhat of a hiatus in the census accounts of the peninsula with his exceptionally interesting rej^ort on Central new to the series  with a conspectus of the capital s historic past   India   The States that contribute separate volumes pay independently for their own operations and the total cost of their census  Owiiig to this fact I was fortunate enough to be spared the unpleasant task of reduci ig budgets  but the exigencies of the India work compelled me in some cases to keep hurrying their Census Commissioners dming the compilation  stage  and my acknowledgments are due to the latter no less than to the Census Su  erintendents in British India for their as efforts to comply with an impatience which they may well have regarded imtirnely  and which must certainly have been inconvenient at any rate to Rai Bahadur Anant Ram  in Kashmir  v dio had to finish off his census at a time of Of the political and economic disturbance with a depleted and inadequate staff  and in Hyderabad Khan Commissioiiers Ghulam Ahmed Mr  other states’ Census administrative from the their subject have approached Mr  Rang Lai in Gwalior points of view like most of the Census Superintendents in British India  iMr  Khan incidentally adding to onr knowledge of the Chenchns  while Mr  Yenkatesa Iyengar in Mysore has given another detailed account of processes of declining industries  Mr  Sanlvara Menon in Cochin has written a thoughtful report as an educationist  a calhng unrepresented in the British series  In Travancore Dr  Pillai has to his credit an admirably produced report embodying not only a brief economic survey of the state but a good deal of fresh information as to the vanishing tribes and disappearing industries of a state which is so advanced that he was able to make a useful experiment in compilation by the employment  as in Cochin  of women as The outstanding report sorters and slip copyists  and very efficient they proved  among the states is again that of Mr  IMukerjea on Baroda who is to be congratulated not only on his admirable presentation of material but on the extreme rapidity with which he produced so comprehensive a volume  His previous experience in  1921 has been put to the best account and I have myself taken advantage of it   He is also responsible for an particularly in the arrangement of fertility figures  innovation in enumeration by billets individuels which may very well bear much fruit  at the next census of India  To j Ir  Trousdell and Mr  Golder of the Government of India Press in Simla I owe both acknowledgments for their patience and despatch  and

well as Mr  Golder for much very useful adAuce and assistance  To Colonel A  J  H  Russell  then Public Health Commissioner  I owe the diagrams of vital statistics and information on several points in Chapter VII  To several others  to more indeed than I can mention here  I owe acknowledgments of some kind for ad dce  information or criticism  Mr  L  S  Vaidyanathan of the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company  Bombay  who has contributed the most comprehensive actuarial examination of the Indian age returns yet attempted and the life tables based on them  Dr  B  S  Guha of the Anthropological Branch of the Zoological Survey Oi India  who carried out for this census a detailed anthropometrical survey of certain castes and tribes and who has contributed his valuable analysis of their physical characteristics to the volume of ethnographical appendices  Colonel R  B  Seymour S  well  Director of the same Department  Rai Bahadur Ramaprasad Chanda and Mr  E  J  H  Mackay  both of the Archaeological Survey  have all helped me with inloimation and friendly criticism and to Dr  Guha again I owe the drawngs of the Bayana  Sialkot andNal crania that appear in Chapter XII  Mr  Yeatts has added to my obligation to him by his assistance in proof reading   My firal but far from least weighty acknowledgments are due first to my own to whose ungrudging co operation is due the early completion of the report  particularly to the  Superintendent Mr  A  R  Chitnis  to whose statistical experience and careful scrutiny of figures must be attributed whatever degree of accuracy office   their presentation here can claim  to the head compiler  Mr  F  E  Wright and his second Mr  Mulherkar  who are primarily responsible for the compilation of Part II and then to predecessors  to Sir Edward Gait in particular  whose work in  my  previous decades has done so much to simplify mine in this  The conception of the social maps was due to a scheme for a population map of India evolved by Colonel Tai dy in 1921 and here modified and adapted to suit small scale maps and a high density of population the idea of the linguistic maps and the record of bilingualism first occurred to me in the course of correspondence vdth Colonel T  C  Hodson  now Wyse Professor of Anthropology in Cambridge  The German anthropologist  Baron  von Eickstedt  suggested a series of maps which would show the population of each village by caste and religion in coloured points of varying shape and size  The system is an admirable one which woukl if applied to India give a m   st   aluabie and intere sriiig record  but the cost of producing series of maps on the large scale iiecessai    to show every village with its inhabitants by castes or tribes was in itsell obviously prohil itive  apart from tlie time and labour involved in compiling the    statistics of caste by villages   A word of apolog   is due on the contents of this report  The opportunities of a am only too conscious of  cen sus of India come if at all but once to most of us  and I  opportunity neglected  for I have left undone that which I ought to have done and I have done much les^ than I should like to have done  Res angusta civitatis is my defence I should be the first to admit it inadequate  but the imperative necessity for a rigid economy made any departure from and still more an   enlargement of the known and familiar paths dangerous as well as extremely difficult  As it was  some of the material actually collected in the enumeration schedules had to be left uncopied and unsorted as a measure of retrenchment  and the industrial statistics of 1921 were not attempted a tally of horsepower  handlooms and mechanical shuttles is hard    a legitimate part of a population census in any case  and the statistics can be just as well collected at another time by the Department of Industries and Labour b   meaiis of the circulation of forms un synchronised with the census schedules  An attempt to collect a return of the educated unemployed on sejtarate schedules v as a fiasco  as though large numbers of the schedules were issued very few were received back the reasons given are various but apathy was probably the prevailing one  Isuch as they are  both the reasons for the failure and the figures obtained will be iound recorded in Chapter IX  The returns of age are probably more accurate than ever before  thanks to the method of treating the figures advocated by Mr  H  G  M   Meikle  as a result of his actuarial examination of the 1921 returns  and adopted for the first time in 1931  On the other hand the figures of urban population in Gujarat and of civil condition must be admitted to be below the prec ious standard of accuracy  a degeneration due in the one case to Congress activities and in the other primarily to the indirect influence of the Sarda Act  but also perhaps in some degree to the very same change in the method of sorting and          \fINTRODUCTION   XV  compiling which has so much improved the return of age unqualified by other In any case the treatment of sociological features of the population of India is much prejudiced by the absence of any general or compulsory registration of births  deaths or marriages an absence which would go far to nullify social legislation such as that imphed in the Sarda Act itself  and to which attention was drawn by the Age of Consent Committee  The difficulties of introducing compulsory registration are no doubt great  but it is not easy to see how social legislation can be really effective without it  Nevertheless some attempt has been made at this census to collect figures for the fertility of females of different social standing and of various occupations in the hope of throwing some much needed light on the rate of reproduction in India  These are censorious days and there were not wanting articles in newspapers of the baser sort to suggest that the figures of fertility were being collected with a view to defaming the people of India  It is possible therefore that critics may be found who will conceive that they detect in Chapters III to VI  or elsewhere in this report  the cloven slots of a considered cloacinity  It is of course impossible to discuss the growth of population without any reference to its health  Those determined to see ill motives will be deterred by no denials  but to those who are not I would offer an assurance  which I hope is not needed  that nothing has been set down in malice  In the first five chapters  except for a page or two on the population problem  I have allowed myself to depart as little as possible from the statistics to be examined  no haunts for ApoUo here  in Chapter VI the social movements and legislation of the decade have called for a short digression before returning to the figures in Chapters VII  VIII and IX  In the last three Chapters 1 have frankly permitted myself  after examining the relative figures  to venture aside to a more speculative treatment of race and rehgion  What was for long the orthodox view of the history of race and culture in India was brilliantly propounded by Sir Herbert Risley in the Census Report of 1901  the work that has been done since makes it probable that there has been a far greater degree of continuity in the pre history of India than was then supposed  and certain that India was not characterised  as Sir Herbert beUeved  by racial or cultural isolation  Much work has to be done before any views on these subjects can claim finality  but certain h  potheses may fairly be advanced on the material accumulated since that census  With the exceptions mentioned I have stayed by my statistics  a  ’alley of dry bones it may be  very far from Helicon  aud I no Ezekiel to clothe them with flesh  content if I have played the part of Joab to hope that I may at least escape the unhappy recompense meted out to that early numberer At any rate 1 have made no naughty omission of Levi and Benjamin of peoples  on purpose  and if some of the tale have gone untold they must be few indeed when the increase alone since 1921 numbers nearly thirty four milhons

numerous  but castes  of dialects  is 225 by the returns of 1931  customs and sects muist be no less diverse  and the same apphes to social  pohtical and economic conditions  Thus the peoples to be

time in spite of this great variety the existence for the most part of a uniform system of administration and of a fairly general distribution of the different racial types from which the population is drawn  together with a  similar  if perhaps less even distribution of religious and social systems  contribute  to give a certain uniformity  if not unity  to the whole  which in spite of local differences is obviously capable of a degree of national consciousness which increases with the spread of education  For the difficulty occasioned by great diversity  \fNATURAL AND POLITICAL DIVISIONS   3  in treating India as a whole is experienced likewise to a more limited extent in each  Province and in most States  since the political boundaries have generally little relation to any other  The difficulty of dealing with the population question by natural divisions is thus greatly enhanced  Obviously the density of the population to the conformation of the soil  to the rainfall and to the crops  all of which are inter dependent  but since the boundaries of administrative units run counter to the divisions of nature  any treatment of the population according to natural divisions is likely to involve the dissipation of figures returned by administrative units into a set of entirely different combinations  This has been attempted for India as a whole on some previous occasions  but the information obtained by such a treatment  however interesting academically  is Demography by natural divisions therefore of little or no administrative value  has been limited to the individual reports of provinces  since in some of the provinees and states the natural divisions are less diverse from divisions political than they are when India is treated as a whole  and within the administrative unit may even be of some practical application   is in immediate relationship  3   In addition to the actual population of India some attempt has been made  to give information as to Indian nationals in other countries or on the High Seas  These figures are necessarily incomplete  but perhaps go further than they have  done on previous occasions by including returns of Indian crews on ocean going vessels shipped during the eight months or so that preceded the final enumeration  Though not in India at the time of the census  these crews form a permanent part of the population visiting their homes from time to time and in many cases returning agriculture as a subsidiary occupation  Strictly speakmg therefore  although the census in intention is one of the de facto population that is of the numbers found in India on February 26th  1931 and not as in the case of the United States  for instance  a de jure population  the terms of a census of actual population have not been observed with excessive punctuality  This indeed would have been impossible  since the remoteness of some parts of India  the difficulty of communications and limi tations imposed by water  snow and wild animals make a completely synchronous enumeration of the whole peninsula an absolute impossibihty   External   \f DISTEIBUTION AND MOVEMENT OF POPULATION   Distribution and Movement  Section  CHAPTEE I   4  it   Aret and Population   The total area covered by this census amounts to 18 hundred thousand sq  miles and the population inhabiting it to 353 millions giving a density for the whole area of 195 persons per sq  mile  This density however is a very variable 4   factor appearing at the lowest as 6 5 persons per sq  mile in the mean density of Baluchistan  Ghagai District of which has only one person to the square  INDIA Shearing densd y by proulnces  and states 12 31  mile  and at its highest at about 2 000 persons per sq  mile in the most thickly populated parts of the south west coast  the general density of Cochin State  including both the thickly populated coast lands and the almost uninhabited highlands  being 814 2 persons per sq  mile and reaching in one village the amazing maximum found in any purely rural population of over 4 000 persons to the sq  mile  There is  however  in Bengal an even higher general level of density  since the Dacca Division has a mean density of 935 persons for a population of 13 864 104  and reaches a rural density of 3 228 per sq  mile for Lohajang thana  and a mean density of 2 413 for Munshiganj sub division which has an area of 294 sq  miles  Of the total population 256 859 787 represents the population of British India proper  the area of which is 862 679 sq  miles  and 81 310 845 that of the States with an area of 712 508 sq  miles  British India with Burma has a population of 271  526 933  and the proportion of the population of the States to British India is 23 to 77 when Burma is included  On the other hand if she be excluded it is 24 to 76  It has been already mentioned that the density of the population varies largely according to the rainfall and it may here be pointed out that in the densest areas those of Cochin  of eastern Bengal  the north east of the United Provinces and of Bihar  the rainfall is heavier than in any other part of India except Assam  where large tracts of hiUs and forest reduce the population in proportion to the area  and in southern Burma where there is considerable room for the increase of population     and where also there are considerable areas of forest and hills  With India’s present population and area we may compare England and Wales with an area of over 58 000 sq  miles and a population of nearly 40 000 000 and a density of 685 persons per sq  mile  or Europe as a whole area 3 750 000 sq  miles  population     475 000 000  mean density 127 persons per sq  mile  with the United States of America area 3 027 000 sq  miles  population 123 000 000  persons per sq  mile 41  or China the area of which including Tibet  Mongolia  Chinese Turkestan and Manchuria is estimated at 4j million sq  miles and the population of which according to the latest estimate  that of Professor Willcox  is 342 000 000 giving a density of     ^  \f\f\f8  ABBA AND POPULATION   5  80 5 persons per sq  mile  though in the fertile areas it is of course much heavier than this  Indeed a more useful comparison should be with China proper  having an area of about 1^ million sq  miles and a general density of probably 200 to 220 persons per sq  mile  It may be added that the total population of the world is now estimated at about 1 850 000 000  and if this be the fact  the population of India forms almost one fifth part of that of the whole world  It should be added  as regards area  that the Survey of India is now revising the official figures of the area of districts and provinces which will involve some modification of the figures given in the census reports  Reffised figures were not ready in time to be utilised generally at this census  but the necessary changes in area and density are for the most part small and unimportant  •  5   The actual increase since 1921  is  to say  10 6 per cent  on the population at  33 895 298  that  Increase due to  r  Census of Popula   Inclusion  Total

India already mentioned  variable that it is impossible to consider the question of movement of the population without going into the question of the distribution and variation of density  for density of population in India depends not on industry  as in the United Kingdom  but on agriculture  and is greatest of course in the most fertile areas  At this census  however  the greatest increase is in the States  where generally speaking the density is lowest  and therefore the increase in the population shown by the figures of this census appears at first sight indicative of pressure upon the margin of cultivation  but while the greatest increase has been in Bikaner  41  9 per cent   this must be put down largely to the increase of irrigation and to the consequent immigration from outside  and one of next highest increases is that of Travancore The increase in in which the density was already among the highest in India  Hyderabad State again is partly to be attributed to an increase of efficiency in the taking of the census and cannot therefore be safely used as a basis of any comparison of the population as it is now and was then  Obviously the greatest increase in population is to be expected in areas such as that of Burma w here the rainfall Where the rainfall is above the mean and the density of the population below it  and the density are at balance  that is  where the population is dense and the rainfall is just adequate as in the southern Punjab  eastern Eajputana  United Provinces  Central India generally and H  E  H  the Nizam’s Dominions  irrigation has abated the liability to complete loss of crop  and improved communications have made it possible to prevent heavy loss of life in times of scarcity  thus enabling the population to increase on the margin of subsistence  How high a population can be supported by agriculture when conditions are favourable  is shown by Cochin with areas here and there carrying over 2 000 and in one rural unit actually 4 090 persons to the sq  mile on land producing rice and coconuts  but principally the latter which leaves more room for the erection of buildings and brings in a higher return than rice in actual cash  In such areas  e g  Cochin and Travancore  the increase in the population has been higher than in the sparsely M22CC    MoTeiMOt   \fCHAPTEK I   6   DISTRIBUTION AND MOVEMENT OF POPULATION   populated areas like Baluchistan or Jaisalmer State where there is no general extension of irrigation  although there would appear to be more scope for an extension of cultivation  On the other hand when these thickly populated areas are examined in detail it appears that the actual rate of increase in population Thus in Travaucore  is greatest in the less populated  and less fertile  areas  there are three natural divisions the lowland very fertile  the midland less so  and the highlands  where the staple crop is tapioca and where irrigation is not Xow in these three natural divisions the density in 1921 was 1 403 practised  persons to the sq  mile  700 persons and 53 respectively  which increased during the decade to 1  743  892 and 82  that is by 24 2  27 4 and 54 7 per cent  respectively  showing a vastly higher rate of increase in the area of least density which is also the area of least fertility  though not as great a numerical increase  Similarly in Bengal the greatest rate of increase has been in the Chittagong Hill Tracts  and in Maciras in the Xilgiris  Where  therefore  there is a population already dense  there is a clearly perceptible spread towards the less profitable land         •  •  The increase of population has also been dependent in some cases on migraon the other hand  the apparent increase may have depended on the Thus the increase of 35 per cent  in Ahmadnagar district  a rather barren upland in the Deccan which suffers from recurring famines  is not due so much to a series of good years or to an extension of cultivation on the subsistence margin  as to trade depression  resulting in numbers of the population staying at home instead of migrating to the ports of Bombay and elsewhere where in normal years they are employed during the census months of February and March Bombay shows a corresponding decrease  probably due  in the particular case of Bombay  largely to the same cause  Other decreases there are which tion  while   failure to migrate   are not so easy to explain  AUfratlon   6  Immigration  when India is taken as a whole  influences the population very little  Table VI shows 730 562 persons as born outside India as against 603 526 in 1921  vfithout taking count in either case of persons born in French The increase is almost entirely in persons born in or Portuguese possessions  Asiatic countries  Against this there must be set off on account of emigration about one million persons who are estimated as having emigrated during the decade under review  ^ligration  however  is of more importance as affecting internal fluctuations of populations  varying in British India from 1 244 249  net  immigrants into Assam to 15 536  net  immigrants into the North West Frontier These figures however include all those whose birth place was outside Province  the province  and do not refer to the decade 1921 31 only  If we take the actual increase due to immigration during the decade in Assam it is found to be only 121 648   consequently if a percentage be taken on the increase of population Assam owes only 10 5 per cent  of its increase to immigration  though its immigration figure is the highest among all provinces  Conversely Bihar and Orissa   uth the greatest loss by emigration shows an increase of 10 8  a little more than that for all India  in spite of the fact that the total loss by emigration is equivalent to almost a third of the actual figure of increase  Migration as between British India and the States has tended in the past to be from the latter to the former but during the last decade this position has been reversed and the trend of migration on the whole is from British India to the States  where the density is generally lower  Bikaner  where the immigrants total 161 303  i e   58 per cent  of its increase in population  is a striking instance the greater number of its immigrants  about 54%  come from British India  and while the natural increase of the population of Bikaner State plus the normal immigration as recorded in 1921 would have resulted in a general increase of 28 per cent  and thereby brought the population back to the 1891 level merely  the increase at this census is much in excess of that amoimt  and this excess may be put down entirely to the extension    of irrigation  Mortality   7 Another factor to be considered is the relation of the birth rate to the death rate and this factor is far from being the same in different sections of the population     How far the fecundity of different races and castes in India is the result of environ   ment and how far it may have become an inherited racial trait fixed at some period in the past history of the people  and how far it depends on prevailing social practices  is extremely difficult to determine in the light of the existing information   but it is easy to show that there is marked variation in different parts of India and   Vide Assam Census Report  1931  page 11

enough to point out that in India the birth rate is everywhere much higher than  in Europe  largely on account of the universality of marriage   the Parsis being perhaps the only Indian community in which late marriage and small families are the rule instead  of the exception  The birth rate is lower among tlie Hindus than in most of other communities probably to some extent on account of the general disapproval of widow remarriage  resulting in larger numbers of women being unreproductive at the child bearing age  and to some extent on that of the greater prevalence of immature maternity  On the other hand  the high birth rate of India is largely discounted by a high death rate  particularly among infants as also apparently among women at child birth  Here again social factors have to be reckoned with  the custom of purdah perhaps exercising its worst effect among the poorer class of Muslims who appear to be more rigid in its observance than the corresponding class of Hindus  This effect is particularly noticeable in crowded urban areas  in which the space available to a woman in purdah and poor circumstances is so small as seriously to affect her health  In the matter of epidemics and of deaths from famine or want  the decade has been particularly favourable to an It is true that the influenza epidemic at the end of the increase in population  pre dous decade is believed to have fallen most severely on the most reproductive ages and should therefore have had a much more lasting efiect than the reduction caused by famine which takes the oldest and the youngest

and is by far the most numerous element in the population of the Andamans has been much reduced on account of the policy of abohshing transportation to the Andamans  The figures of the foreign population  including convicts and ex con dcts  show a steady increase of Burmese and Karens  The climate suits them and they are accustomed to similar surroundings and the indications are that the permanent population of the islands will ultimately be predominately Burmese   7 66  only  •  The most striking figures for these islands are those for the indigenous Negrito population which has shown a decrease respectively of 42  30  40 and 41 per cent  at each successive census of this century and a total decrease of over 75 per cent  If the present rate of decrease continue much longer the Andasince 1901 alone  manese will be extinct by the end of this century  The Census Superintendent in his report is content to damn with faint praise the policy of civilizing the aboriwines and the institution of the Andaman Home but that policy  now abandoned resulted in the space of 7 decades in a greater curtailment of human life than the Andamanese themselves are likely to have effected by their more direct methods ‘  Andaman and Nicobar Islands   \f12  CHAPTER I    DISTRIBUTION AND MOVEMENT OP POPULATION   In the Nicobars on the other hand  whence the penal settlement was removed in 1888  there has been an increase of 10 4 per cent  since 1921 in spite of the deficiency  of females  who are only 881 to every 1 000 males  The ratio of females to males has increased by 112 per mille since 1921 when the ratio was 769 females per 1 000 males  and by 40 per mille during the present century  If Xicobarese of tribal religion alone be examined the increase in the sex ratio is from 866 females per 1 000 males in 1921 to 939 in 1931   in as many centuries   AtMm   present population of a nine and quarter million shows 11  Assam with a The decade from the point of view of increase 1921 an since of 15 7 per cent  public health has been “ the best in the history of Assam ”  and the tea industry  which is  of course  the main industry of the province beyond ordinary agriculture  was on the whole in a flourishing condition  starting the decade  with a recovery from the depression of 1919 1921  booming in 1923 and 1924 and remaining prosperous until the end of 1927  when the present depression began to be felt as a result of foreign competition and over production  The increase in population  in spite of being the highest recorded in Assam  has been mainly due to natural increase and not to an increase by immigration which only formed ten per cent  of the total  The general economic condition of the cultivator does not seem to have deteriorated up to 1929 in spite of a general tendency to decay on the part of the cottage industries  Up to that year the price of agricultural produce had increased and expenditure on luxuries was found by the Assam Banking Enquiry Committee to have increased likevvdse  The standard of living had gone up  and so also apparently had expenditure on involved marriage and other ceremonies  This had increased indebtedness the average agriculturahst has not learned the importance of saving ”  and The increase in population has extended to the whole province  Hills and Plains districts ahke  but is lowest in the Surma Valley  which is the most densely populated part and but little affected by migration  The area of the province has been slightly extended on the frontier towards Burma  but that extension of area has only accounted for 1  25 per cent  of the increase  The area of Assam is 67 334 square miles and its V’anation of population per cent  population is 9 247 857  having a mean denArea lu

subsistence to scattered villages  the density is only 39  There are no industrial towns in the province The population is of a very mixed character  In of any size or importance  the Brahmaputra valley the indigenous population consists of Bodo and Shan tribes mostly Hinduised  and with an aristocracy of caste Hindus ultimately of foreign extraction but  hke the small Muslim population settled in the 17th century  completely identified with the country and the people The recent immigrants consist of the valley by a residence of many generations  mostly aboriginals from the Madras Agency either of tea garden coolies  Tracts  the Central Provinces and Chota Nagpur  who take up land and settle down in the country  and of MusUm cultivators from Maimansingh District in Bengal who have of recent years swarmed into the lower districts of the valley and opened up large areas of waste land  Prolific breeders and industrious cultivators but unruly and uncomfortable neighbours  these immigrants threaten to swamp entirely the indigenous inhabitants and in the course of two or three decades to change the whole nature  language and religion of the Brahmaputra vaUey and to assimilate it to the Mushm areas of Sylhet  where the population is not Assamese but essentially Bengah  whether Muslim or Hindu  In the other district of the Surma Valley  the plains part of Cachar  the last stronghold of the Kachari kings and once completely Kachari       «  \fASSAM   1   has become a Bengah colony entirely submerging the indigenous Kachari  who has retained his tribal nationality only in the North Cachar Hills  There as in the rest of the Hill districts the indigenous tribes still hold their own  resentful  of the intrusion of the plainsmen whether Bengali or Assamese and maintaining their own languages and distinctive cultures and racially belonging for the most part to Burma rather than to India   in character   12  Baluchistan  the most sparsely

that the charge of a single enumerator involved the travelling of distances of from 50 to 160 miles  a generally synchronous census was obviously an impossibility  and  the regular synchronized census on the standard schedule covered only 200 square miles and a population mostly alien  The difficulties of obtaining an accurate census are further enhanced by the nomadic character of the population  which is constantly moving from one part of the country to another in search of    pasturage or work  and by the periodic movements not only of the local population towards Sind  Afghanistan or Persia in the autumn  but also of foreign nomads from Afghanistan into and through Baluchistan in the winter  These nomads return in the spring  and in the summer Quetta with its cool climate is becoming a seasonal resort from the overbearing heat of Sind  The census therefore of Baluchistan is a census of her winter population and does not necessarily represent with any accuracy the population to be found there in the summer months  which the Census Superintendent estimates at 974 000  The mean density of Baluchistan is 6 persons per square mile  a little more than Tibet with 4 and about the same as Newfoundland exclusive of Labrador but The decade this density falls in the Chagai district to 1 person per square mile  started with a period of famine resulting from the drought of 1920 21 and although the years 1923 25 were good the later years were afflicted by locusts and the decade As a result of famine and as a whole was below the usual level of prosperity  scarcity and of the damage done by the invading sands of the Chagai deserts  which bury and lay waste the cultivated areas to the south and east of them and choke both sources and channels of irrigation  the province lost some thousands of its scanty indigenous population by migration  Prices ruled high until 1930 when they fell Health was poor and to the disease which naturally to a level phenomenally low  follows famine conditions were added serious epidemics of cholera  small pox and measles  A general increase of motor traffic has almost caKsed the disappearance of animal drawn vehicles during the decade  and 132 miles have been added to railways  The population increased by 69 000  of which 39 500 represents a natural increase  but the phenomenal increase of 45 5 per cent  in the Tribal Areas is not entirely beyond suspicion  and if the natural population of Baluchistan b  alone considered  the 1911 figure has not yet been recovered  The population is far from uniform in character comprising as it does Brahui  Baloch  Lasi and Makrani with their satellite tribes of Loris  Dehwars  Langahs and Naqibs to say nothing of Pathans and Jatts and Persians  The country is of great historical importance    Baluchistan   \f   CHAPTER I  DISTRIBUTION AND  MOVEMENT OF POPULATION   14  and tlie researches in recent vears of Sir Aurel Stein indicate that Baluchistan was once a fertile country supporting a

sq  miles  Thirty sq  miles have been added since 1921 from Bihar and Orissa but changes in calculation of area have increased the size shown in the tables by an additional 678 sq  miles  The total population returned is 51 087 338 for Bengal  of which 50 114 002 were in British and 973 336 in State territory  and 109 808 for Sikkim  the population of Bengal being more than onesixth of the total for British India  The density in British Bengal is now 646 persons per sq  mile  while that of Sikkim is only 39  Excluding Calcutta the density of Bengal varies from 2 105 in Howrah district to 43 in the Chittagong Hill Tracts  but by far the greater part of the province has a density of over 500 to the sq  mile  and if smaller units are taken a much higher rural density is found in many places  Dacca Division having a mean density of 935  Munshiganj sub division of 2 413  and Lohajang thana of 3 228 per sq  mile  The rate of increase of population has been 7 3 per cent  since 1921 and that of Sikkim 34 4 per cent  Cooch Behar State is one This decrease  0‘27 per cent   of the few in India that shows a decrease since 1921  is entirely Hindu    4 76%  and is attributed to the expansion of settled cultivation by Muslims which has the effect of driving the Hinduised tribes  Koch  Mech  Poliya  etc   into the foothills or eastwards into Assam  a process observed likewise in the adjoining Bengal districts  It is also suggested that this decrease is partly due to changes in social custom  such as the abandonment of widow remarriage as part of a campaign of social elevation  and to changes in environment unfavourable to pre existing adaptations  Tripura State on the other hand  with only 93 persons to the sq  mile  has experienced an increase of 25 6 per cent   and the thinly

1929  tea was prosperous till 1927 coal has not been prosperous  Throughout Bengal there seems to have been a general rise in the standard of living  not shown in an improved or more expensive diet  though it is reported that the need for a better balanced dietary is indicated by the fact that an ordinary cultivator is found to improve and gain weight on prison fare  but in minor amenities such as umbrellas and shoes  shirts and coats “ now worn by thousands who would never have dreamt of wearing them ten years ago ”  while the hurricane lantern is almost universally displacing the

set in by the census of 1931 iiad driven back to their homes the countrymen who normally come down to Bombav to work during the cold weather and partly no doubt owing to suburban expansion  but every other unit in the confines of the Presidency proper has increased in population during the decade and the general rate of increase  13  7 per cent   is well above that In the case of the cities the increase was juobably greater than of India as a whole  that actually shown  since the municipal authorities did not in all cases co operate whole heartedly  while some were definitely obstructive  In Surat  Kaira  Villeparle and Broach at any rate the enumeration was probably defective  and at Ahmadabad it was made impossible to carry it out at all in many parts of the city  For that town therefore an estimate has been made of the numbers not enumerated and added to the actual returns for the purposes of all tables in which details bv reliAden alone has fallen while the Bombav States gion  age  etc   are not required  and  even more  Sind ha^ e increased at a higher rate than the province as a whole  though Sind has been visited by di sastrous floods and in 1929 30 revenue to the extent of Rs  57 71 940 had to be remitted on account of damage by In marked contrast to all the decades since 1891 no district has suffered locusts  from a single very l ad season during the whole period under review  Five seasons of the ten were good and five were moderate  and the fact that the prices of food grains fell more slowly than most others while cotton remained exceptionally high was of great benefit to the cultivator  At the same time wages and the demand for labour showed a tendency to rise rather than to fall until 1930  and then did not fall proportionately to the drop in prices  In the towns the decade was also one of prosperity until 1927 28  and in the earlier half of the decade urban labour seems to have reached an unprecedented standard of comfort  but at the end of the period the trade depression  aggravated by the civil disobedience movement caused much unemplo Tnent and discomfort  Burma   The census of Burma was taken on February 24th two days earlier than

and 5 000 to the Southern Shan States  In the Salween division the population of the Karenni States decreased  and the increase in the rest of that division was largely due to the mines in Salween

of Pegu was destroyed by a disastrous earthquake which did damage elsewhere as well  Burnia grows rnore rice than her population consumes  and although cultivable land is not readily capable of extension the area under irrigation was extended by some 317 000 acres dining the decade  Industrial expansion  particularly in the production of oil  has been important in some districts and railways

the effect of the influenza epidemic upon women of the child bearing ages can be traced in certain age groups at the present census  Up to the end of 1921 pubhc health was bad  Cholera  plague and malaria caused exceptional mortality  In 1922 however the satisfactory monsoons of that and the previous year reduced the death rate from 44 to 29  though the birth rate also fell from 38 to 36 per 1 000  Good monsoons and healthy years continued until 1926 27  which was marked by serious floods  and 1927 28 saw the beginning of the decline in prosperity  Wheat was attacked by rust and more than half of the crop was lost in the northern districts of the pro vfince in that year and health deteriorated  The following year brought the recurrence of non co operation  agrarian agitation and general depression  another unsatisfactory agricultural year in the north of the piovince  and much unhealthiness from cholera  plagae  small pox  influenza and malaria  On the whole  however  the intervening prosperity more than balanced the depression at either end of the decade  The net area cropped increased from 23 585 215 acres to 25 364 376 the addition of a thousand miles of irrigation channels added nearly a hundred thousand acres of irrigated land a thousand miles of metaUed road were added to the existing metalled roads  and many new bridges  and 300 miles of It is significant of the connection between prosperity and population railway  that the growth of the latter was very small in the north of the province which suffered three very bad years at the end of the decade  Elsewhere  as in other provinces  the highest rate of increase was in the most thiuly populated areas  The infant mortahty rate appears to be higher in the Central Provinces than in India as a whole or in most other parts of India  but the rate of increase at this census has been 12 6% for the province  Both the natural features and the population are very varied  The Narbada vaUey in the north

but the forest tribes speak Dravidian or Munda languages  In Bastar State  the remotest part of the province  there has been much increase in communication  but the Administrator reports that the

important scale as well as cardamom plantations on the western slopes of the plateau continued to flourish and tea to survive  though plantations of rubber and agave are being abandoned  but the staple crop is rice of which the province produces more than it consumes  Both for rice and coffee the decade was favourable except for the heavy floods in The fall in prices  steady till 1929  at the end of the decade caused paddy 1924  to be sold at exceedingly low rates and the area under rice cultivation to decrease from 84 587 to 82 822 acres  Urban population has increased and a general

the value of the crops raised has been nearly 46 per cent  which not a fall in the quantity of the crop but in the level of prices  At the same time possibilities of agriculture on present methods have more or less reached a maximum and the Presidency can no longer feed itself  The decade was healthy  and not only has it been free from epidemics but the skilled research of Colonel Russell  the Director of Public Health  has made it possible to cope with epidemics when they arise  and in the case of cholera to predict their occurrence and so to forestall their virulence  Cholera  which is endemic in the south of the Presidency  has proved to have a six year cycle  The vital statistics of Madras are worthy of reference since this province is the only one whose registration of birth and death approaches anything like a satisfactory standard  Even so in 1930 some 62 000 unregistered births and 20 000 unregistered deaths were detected by inspecting officers in the Presidency  In some parts of Madras emigration takes place on a larger scale to Assam  Burma  Ceylon and Malaya  the annual loss being some 13 000  and though the dechne in the planting industry has resulted in large numbers of returns  these had not had their full effect by the time the census took place  even from Burma  As in the accuracy of her vital statistics  Madras is ahead of other provinces in the matter of birth control  A tendency is observed by the Census Superintendent for men at any rate to marry later  and contraceptive methods are advocated by influential persons and widely advertised in the press  The Census Superintendent writes “ Ten years should show a marked growth in their popularity  Books on the subject are to be found in any bookstall or pubhsher’s list and whether they are read as mild pornography or for serious guidance it is unhkely that they can fail to exert some influence ”  He adds  as a portent  that contraception of a crude kind has been observed among the Goundans of Salem to prevent large families  the fragmentation of holdings and the weakening of the joint family system   The external boundaries have not altered  Internally there have been some changes

that of the latter proidnce  ISevertheless signs of industrial development are appearing and cotton mills are springing up at small country centres supplied by the cotton growing areas they adjoin  Thus Pollachi  a small town in Coimbatore district  had six nulls in 1921 but thirty in 1931  Cheap power from water ia a possibility and the use of electricity is steadily advancing in popularity  as

the decade opened the agricultural position was bad and the frontier was disturbed  a condition which  however  benefits the inhabitants of the administered districts financially  Both contractors and unskilled labour do well and “ to the Pathan of fighting age times of unrest call up memories of a princely pay earned in princely idleness  guarding with a government rifle and the prestige of his race some lonely spot on a winding frontier road The situation on the frontier improved rapidly  but this improvement was followed by outbreaks of internal disturbance in 192 t and 1927 of a commimal nature and in 1929 by revolutionary outbreaks all over the province culminating in the very serious riots of April 1930 in Peshawar with inevitable repercussions among the border tribes  though the situation was restored in time for the census to be taken generally under normal conditions  Agriculturally the decade was satisfactory iintil 1924  less satisfactory from 1924 to 1928 but improved from 1928 to 1930 when a deficient fall of rain and an excessive fall in prices combined to reduce greatly the area sown for crops  Rs  22 06 956 of revenue were remitted on account of damage by locusts in the vears 1929 30  Public health was bad in the first half of the decade  which the Census Superintendent attributes to the after effects of the influenza epidemic  but the second half was one of “ unintenupted good health which “ restored to the people their normal vitality ”  and the increase of population in the administered districts since 1921 has been 7 7%  The Co operative Credit movement was started in 1925  and in 1926 there were 16 societies with a membership of 365 and a working capital of Rs  39 317  In 1930 there were 166 societies with 5 825 members and a working capital of Rs  8 92 000  The primary necessity of the province is a settled economc outlook without which an increase in population disproportionate to that in wealth and productive efficiency will involve poverty and discontent and in all probabihty a destructive agitation and very serious disturbance   22 The Punjab is the eighth province in India in area  but with the Punjab States Agency

irrigation has extended by over 19 per cent  and has added 2 000 000 acres of irrigated land during the decade  though a drawback to irrigation has appc ired in the tendency towards the rise of the subsoil water level  which forces up from below salts which make the surface Agilcultural wages remained high until 1928 and soil unfit for cultivation  have not fallen so rapidly as prices  Agile ultural credit has increased its capital from 216 13 lakhs in 1921 to 817 91 in 1931 and its owned capital from 113 to 317 lakhs  and an indication of agricultural prosperity is to be found in the rise by 22 per cent  in the price of agricultural land  There has been a spread of improved varieties of wheat  cotton and sugar cane and a great advance in the local manufacture of cane mills  ploughs  irrigation wheels and other agricultural implements  In 1921 the Census Superintendent remarked on the noticeable absence of any local manufacture of agricultural implements  but now at Batala  in Gurdas  ur  alone there are 21 iron foundries with an annual output of over 19 000 imT lements valued at Rs  537 000  The comparative prosperity and high prices of the earlier part of the

UNITED PROVINCES OF AGRA AND OUDH   The decade has of the earning inhabitants are actively engaged in agricultui’e  been a good one in respect of rainfall and crops  in spite of having opened with famine conditions in Gonda and Bahraich  and closing with drought and locusts in certain restricted areas  and with a serious collapse of agricultural prices  The Sarda irrigation canal  on which wnrk was started in 1921  was opened in the main branch  in 1928  The system comprises some 4 000 miles of main channel and distributaries and 1 700 miles of drains over an area of six million acres of which it is anticipated that on an average 1 350 000 will be irrigated annually by its means  Xew’ masonry w ells to the number of 150 314 have been constructed during the decade  mostly at the expense of the cultivators themselves  but the net cultivated area of the province has not increased and the double cropped area is also stationary  The principal food crops are rice  millet  wheat  barley and pulse  Sugarcane is very important in the north west and oilseeds are cultivated often in lines sown through fields of other crops  The condition of hvestock during the greater part of the decade was unsatisfactory on account of epidemics  The enquiries made by the Banking Enquiry Committee in 1929 indicated that 46° of tenants and peasant proprietors were then debt free  and 22% owed less than tw^o years’ rent  Of landlords a larger number were in debt and their debts w^ere very much greater  The fragmentation of holdings is a serious disadvantage to the agriculturist  and the reserves built up during the first seven prosperous years of the decade have been exhausted by the collapse at its close  In 1929 31 revenue w’as remitted to the amount of Es  1 68 50 000  and about three times that amount in rents  In industry  of which Cawnpore is the principal centre  the numbers of factories rose by 72 5% from 218 to 376 and of persons employed in them by 33 2% from 69 000 to 92 000  and the increase has been principally in permanent as distinct from seasonal employment  There has been a marired improvement in public health  particularly in the matter of deaths from plague  cholera and small pox  The increase in population during the decade has been greater in the States than in British territory but amounts over the whole province to 6 7°  o  tfie densitv being greater in the east than in the west  In this connection it is pointed out that the higher castes are predominant in the w est of the province  and the lower in the east  or in cases of castes uniformly distributed  the w^estern branches are socially superior  Generally speaking  however  the population of the United Pro  inces  like its language  is more uniform than that of most provinces in India  24  Baroda State occupies 8 164 sq  miles in Gujarat and Kathiawar  but is not a compact whole  consisting  as it does  of four major and several minor disconnected areas  with a total population of 2 443 007 and a mean density of 299 per sq  mile  The population has increased by 14 9% since 1921 The natural increase is estimated at 9 4%  and the increase due to immigration was swollen by 26 755

The total literate points of view a cause for alarm rather than for satisfaction  population of India in 1921 was 22 623 651 and is now 28 131 315  so that the mere increase of population during the intervening period has exceeded the former figure by 11 million  that is by 50 per cent    and still exceeds the latter by 20 per cent   Nature of the problem   \f30  CHAPTER I    DISTRIBUTION AND MOVEMENT OF POPULATION   Even in Travancore State  where the percentage of literacy is much higher than in most parts of India  but where the population has increased by 27 per cent   the  proportion of literacy has fallen from 24 2 per cent  in 1921 to 23 9 per cent  in 1931 though in India as a whole it has risen from 7 per cent  to 8 per cent  •  Recent writers on the population question in India  e g   Wattal and Ranadive  have directed theii  attention primarily to the question of food production  Their argument is that the population of India is already living permanently on the verge of scarcity and any increase is bound to result in an insufficiency of the food Recent experience  however  throws doubt on this theory the general supply  slump in the price of food  and the difficulty found by cultivators in selling their produce  suggest that the danger of a shortage of the food supply is not the most It is not argued that this is not a danger to be serious aspect of the question  reckoned with  and in any case the maximum population possible is very far from identical with the maximum population desirable  since the rise of population on the subsistence margin must reduce the standard of living  but it would seem that the point has not yet been reached at which the ability of the country to feed its occupants is seriously taxed  The position of economists in regard to the west now’ appears to be that “ the devastating torrent of babies ” is being reduced to a trickle  and that even if it were swelled again the rapid developments both mechanical and biological that are taking place in the world production of food  would be more than sufficient to cope with the flood  so that it is progressively easier to obtain subsistence  It may be doubted whether either supposition is yet applicable In the first place there are as yet no indications of any tento Indian conditions  dency on the part of the countryman to modify his view of the blessedness of the man w’ho has a quiverful of sons and is not a shamed to meet his enemy in the gate     and  in the second  httle sign that agriculture is likely to be appreciably aSected during the next decade by means such as those which have so greatly increased wheat production on the American continent  It is however obvious that apart from the law of diminishing returns the abihty of agriculture to provide an occupaIn Europe it has been estimated that the maximum population tion is hmited  which can be supported by agricultural occupations is 250 to the sq  mile  while an estimate of somewhat higher density has been made in the case of the United States of America  and the island of Porto Rico in the West Indies has an agricultural population of nearly 400 to the sq  mile  The number is  as we have seen  very  \fPOPULATION PROBLEM   31  much  greater than this in many parts of India  and the rural population which attains the extraordinary density mentioned of parts of Bengal and of the Malabar Coast indicates the extent to which fertile land intensively cultivated together with fish yielding waters could sustain a population whose material wants are reduced to the minimum by the natural environment of a tropical climate  These  of course  are extreme cases taken from the two most fertile parts of India   but generally speaking the maximum density of the agricultural population can be far greater in India than in Europe  not only on account of the greater fertiUty of the land but on account of the diminution in the absolute necessities of life corresponding to a less rigorous climate  The real difficulty is that to cultivate on anything like economic lines the number of individuals that can work on a given area of ground and though the food product may be ample for many more than that is limited number  a large increase in the population must either lead to excessive subdivision of the areas cultivated  and so to a diminution in production on account of uneconomic holdings  or on the other hand  to a floating population which is not engaged in agriculture and which has nothing to exchange with the producers for the food which it requires  The employment of this surplus in industrial activity would of course  meet the difficulty for a time  but can only prove a permanent cure if the increase of the population he limited not only to the food producible but also to the saturation point of the demand for industrial labour  When the latter point is passed  as in the United Kingdom  where the increase in population during the last decade was approximately equivalent to the number of unemployed in 1931  unemployment will arise and the fact that the food supply is adequate is to this extent irrelevant  As in some parts of Europe  fife on the land as a cultivator is an end in itself rather than a mere means of production of victuals  hence the real danger of a growth of population which must suffer discomfort because this end becomes rapidly more difficult of reahsation  The present problem in India would therefore seem to be less the actual total increase of the population  than the increase of that portion of the population  by far the greater part of course  which is occupied in agriculture and allied pursuits  i e   the population represented by sub class I of the Occupation Table and an additional comphcation of the problem appears in the fact that the cultivating classes in India generally lack the capital required for the extension of cultivation beyond the existing margin  particularly where the cultivation practised is already dependent on a somewhat problematic rainfall  Mechanical improvements which reduce the need for labour are a doubtful palliative  though no such doubt attaches to biological improvements  enabling a better crop to be obtained from a smaller area  Labour saving devices will do little for a peasantry whose work takes up part only of the year and certainly they will not enable a greater number of peasants to live on the same area of land where there is neither demand nor market facihties for the minor products of agriculture which contribute to the income of the European small holder or on which  such as poultry  pigs or potatoes  he may principally depend        appears to be the general opinion of Indian economists who population problem of this country that the only practical method of limiting the population is by the introduction of artificial methods of birth control  though it is not easy to exaggerate the difficulties of introducing such methods in a country where the vast majority of the population regard the propagation of male offspring as religious duty and the reproach of barrenness as a terrible punishment for crimes committed in a  former incarnation  It is justly pointed out by the Census Superintendent of Mysore State that the practice of universal and of early marriage is a social custom and is not  in fact  followed from religious motives  but it is almost always religious arguments which are put forward in opposition to a change in social custom by any society anywhere  and though the religious sanction may be the result rather than the cause of the social custom  this fact only gives the sanction greater force  Nevertheless a definite movement towards artificial birth control appears to be taking place and is perhaps less hampered by misplaced prudery than in some countries which claim to be more civilized thus not only is artificial control publicly advocated by a number of medical writers but Madras can boast a Neo Malthusian League with two Maharajas  three High Court judges and four or five men very prominent 35  discuss     It  the       An examination of the population question ae regards

would appear  in view of the present rate of increase  that efforts to reduce the rate of infantile mortality should be preceded by precautions to reduce the birth rate  and that if the luxury of baby in public life  ‘  weeks  be permitted they should at least be accompanied by instruction in birthA move in this direction has already been made by the Government of Mysore State  which in 1930 sanctioned the establishment of birth control clinics in ’  control   the four principal hospitals of the State   There are perhaps other methods of checking an excessive increase in populaIt has been clearly demonstrated in Europe that a rise of the standard in living is normally accompanied by a fall in the birth rate  and the same principle no doubt operates in this country but  even while we must admit the truth of Bacon’s aphorism that “ Kepletion is an Enemy to Generation ”  a mere superfluity of food supply is not enough  as it only enables the possessor to breed up to the subsistence level again  In order that a higher standard of living may affect the rate of reproduction it is apparent that not only is an increase in education and culture involved  since it seems definitely established that intellectual activity acts as a check upon fertility  but also the psychological appreciation of a higher proba bility of survival  Eecent studies of the population problem in the Pacific by Eivers  Pitt Eivers  Eoberts and others have clearly demonstrated the importion      tance of psychological factors as affecting the increase or decrease of the population  and although the environment is generally entirely different in India  that is no reason for supposing that psychology is any less important here in its action on the rate of reproduction  It is also likely that a changed outlook  in which a greater value was attached to the goods of this world and less regard paid to the speculative possibilities of the next  would operate in the same direction but it seems doubtful if a materialistic standpoint would commend itself to Indian culture     Assam   Bombay   Punjab   Central Prorinoes and Berar   Burma   and Orissa and All India   Bihar  Madras   Bengal

Bengal  Malthus and Doubleday   Starting with the proposition that population is necessarily limited by the means of subThat deriving  sistence there are in the field two principal rival theories of population growth   from Malthus has been  stated thus     first that  population invariably increased where the  means of subsistence increased unless prevented by some very powerful and obvious checks and secondly that these checks which repress the superior power of population and keep its effects on a level with the means of subsistence are all resolvable into moral restraint  vice and In other words nature having arranged for population to increase at a rate at which it  misery   bound to overtake and pass the means of subsistence periodically redresses the balance by famines  epidemics and other calamities unless human intelligence steps in and prevents the excessive increase either by moral restraint or by measures for limiting the birth rate or for despatching the excess of population  The other theory derives from Thomas Doubleday and It is that when the existence of a species is endangered gives nature a rather less sinister role  “ a corresponding effort is invariably made by nature for its preservation and continuance by an increase of fertihty  and that this especially takes place whenever such danger arises from a is  diminution of proper nourishment or food  so that consequently the state of depletion or the deplethoric state is favourable to fertility  and that  on the other hand  the plethoric state or the state of repletion  is unfavourable to fertility in the ratio of the intensity of each state ”  It has been thought that this statement lays too much stress upon food and the position has been thusf restated “In circumstances of ease the birth rate tends to fall in circumstances of hardship the birth rate tends to rise ”     Pefl’s Law  of Births and  Deaths      The recorded census figures of population in Bengal probably cover too short a period During the last sixty years the population of Bengal has become nearly half as large again as it was in 1872  There can be no question o^ intelhgence checks having operated  and Bengal has been free from major calamities except in the decade before last when the influenza epidemic from which vdrtuaUy the to offer clear support to either one of these theories against the other   whole world sufl ered operated to reduce the rate of increase during the decade to a figure lower than an   in its recorded census history  If the Malthusian doctrine holds  Nature is not yet aware of any need to apply a check to the increase of population in Bengal  If the Darwinian theory holds and “ fecundity is in direct relation to the chances of death ”  and if the “ law ” of Doubleday apphes  Nature still finds it necessary to maintain in Bengal a high birth rate in order to keep pace with the high death rate  In some points at least the Malthusian theory fails to explain the facts  In European countries and America  where most investigation has been carried out  it has been found J  a  that the birth rate is negatively correlated with wealth and  6  that the indirect psychological and social effect of relative poverty as contrasted with relative wealth express themselves definitely and clearly in the sexual activity of human beings and through sexual activity in birth rates  On the Malthusian theory in the wealthier classes where the means of subsistence are plentiful the population should increase more rapidly than in the poorer classes where they are less plentiful unless there were some volimtar   interference with the rate of birth  The evidence of any such voluntary restriction is not conclusive and the theor ’ generally held is that fertility itself decreases in the higher classes with increasing wealth and culture  The Malthusian doctrine also fails to account for the fact that a high birth rate and a high death rate are apparently invariably found together and that conversely where there is a low birth rate there is also a low death rate  This fact and the extreme doubtfulness of any evidence to show that conscious limitation of the family can account for the whole or a considerable part of the decrease in the birth rate where it is low have led to the enunciation of the theory^ that the net result of the variations of the degree of fertility under the direct action of the environment will bear an inverse proportion to the variations of the capacity for survival  ” Under this theory variations in the birth rate are mainly due to the operation of a natural law which adjusts the degree of fertihty to suit the death rate of the race  The theory involves the postiflate that the same conditions which lead to a reduction in the death rate lead also to a decrease in fertihty in some manner not yet known  The author of the theory suggests that the hormones assist in regulating the fertihty of the germ cells  that the output of hormones by the endocrine glands is regulated by the nervous system which responds to the action of the environment and that the variations in the degree of fertihty in response to the direct action of the environment will bear an inverse proportion to the development of nervous energy  Raymond Pearl’s Logistic  Curve   What may be considered to be a development of the second of these two theories is that put forward by l Eaymond Pearl  This theory deduces that populations grow in size accorchng to the same mathematical law that individual animals and plants follow in the growth of their bodies in size  and that human populations grow according to the same law as do experimental populations of lower organisms  The law of growth postulated on these deductions may be expressed by an equation with three constants  and the curve representing this equation is   •f  bj  W   5  Thompson  Populalion   A Htudy in Malthusianism  1915   By H   Sutherland  i ec Proceediujs of World Population Conference

\fPOPULATION PROBLEM IN BENGAL  called by Pearl a “ logistic curve  41  Equations have been worked out and fitted to the popula   tions of fifteen countries of the world  the whole world and the population of certain cities and  have been shown to give over the whole recorded census history of each a very reasonable congruity with the recorded facts  Assuming the mathematical form of the curve this theory allows account to be taken of the fact that a population is necessarily confined to a certain area and therefore must have an upper limit of population as well as a lower  which may be nil  and for the fact that population growth takes place in cycles conditioned amongst other factors by cultural achievement  It is possible that over a restricted period the logistic curve may not give so accurate an approximation to the recorded population as a curve of some other form  As a method of predicting future growth also it is liable to the irruption of influences not previously prevalent  Pearl states “ predictions of future growth may at any time be altered by the entrance into the situation of new economic or social factors of a different sort The poputo those which have operated during that past period which the equation covers  lation may be stimulated to start upon a new cycle of growth or slighter but still in kind new factors may alter somewhat the upper limiting value of the present cycle ”  In certam instances however the logistic curve calculated by him gives astonishiugl ^ close approximations to the population actually recorded later  For the United States of America in 1930  for instance  a curve worked out before the census of 1920 suggested a population within 5 per 1 000 of that actually enumerated  Three curves of Pearl’s logistic type have been fitted to the census population of Bengal and the population calculated from them is compared with the observed population  The first is the equation worked out by iVIr  P  J  Griffiths  I C S   audit was hoped to give in an appendix brief notes on the method by which it was calculated  Difficulties in setting up the rather compficated mathematical formula involved howev^er have prevented this  Briefly however  the method consists in fitting a curve of the required type to three of the recorded census figures and then adjusting it by successive approximations to all the recorded figures  The desired approximation is one in which the algebraic sum of differences between the calculated and the actually recorded populations is nil and the sum of the squares Mr  Griffiths’ curve was worked out for the population of these differences is a minimum  actually recorded in Bengal treating the interval between each census count as being exactly ten years and assuming that a negligible error only was introduced by this treatment and by neglecting to make an adjustment for change of area  For the other two calculations the  The logistic curve applied to Bengal   recorded census population was adjusted to represent the estimated population in the area now constituting Bengal on the 1st March of each census year after 1881 and on the 1st March 1871  In making this calculation it was assumed that the population between any two census years changed at a uniform rate and that the rate of change between March 1871 and the date of the census in 1872 was the same as between 1872 and 1881  In arriving at the third equation allowance has been made for a small factor which Mr  Griffiths has noted as being disregarded in his calculation  The equations give a curve of reasonable fit and the last shown is the most accurate approximation for the observations in so far as the algebraic sum and the sum of squares of differences between the observed and calculated population at all census years from 1881 to 1931 is less with this equation than with the other two  whilst for all years including 1871 the sum of the differences is least and the sum of their squares not indeed least but very near to it   On the first equation the rate of increase was being successively enhanced till 1881 when it began to decline and the maximum population would be about 74 millions  which would be pracOn the third equation the point of maximum increase was passed tically attained in 2063 A  D  in 1872  the rate of growth is also diminishing and a maximum population of about 68  mdlions would be expected which would be approximately reached in 2076 A  D  On neither equation is any lower limits of population implied  i e   the equations do not suggest that the present cycle of population growth began at any definite period  although on the third equation Bengal should have had a population of not less than two millions in 1668 A  D  Mr  close as  Griffiths also fitted curves to the population of  is  The correspondence of these obtained by the equation for the  Ueneral tendencies of population  growth and upper limit of population suggested   Muslims and Hindus  figures   The logistic  total  curve applied to the Muslim  particularly for Hindus  is not so population  but the Muslim equation  a reasonable fit for the years 1881 to 1921  The total maximum population and Hindu towards which the equations suggest that each community is tending would be for population  Muslims about 32 millions and for Hindus about 23J millions in aggregate these figures fall short by 14 to 20 millions of the upper asymptotic population calculated for all communities  The Mushm and Hindu equations imply that the point at which the rate of increase ceased to be successively greater than in previous decades was passed in about 1886 by the Muslims and 1812 by the Hindus who are now approaching a stationary population  In any case the implication is that the Hindu community is further along its present growth cycle than the Muslim in other words that it is approaching its maximum whilst by comparison the Muslim community is stiU gives        rapidly growing   It is possible to find a suggested explanation   if  this is actually true   fact that Muslims live mainly in the healthier regions of Eastern Bengal  and Hindus  in the  in the less  healthy and less progressive portions of West Bengal but it would be interesting if similar calculations have been made  to know whether the implication arises also in the case of other provinces     \fAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER I   42 Estimate of population in 1941   The equations for total populations suggest a population of between 53 and 53J millions The communal equations appear  and Mr  Griffiths holds them  to be inappropriate  Equations of a more complicated form might give closer correspondence with the observed in 1941   census figures  hut the calculation involves very great labour  they might give no better estimates for the future and in any case they are scarcely worth making in view of the fact that only seven counts are on record  For the future all that can be said is that if the type of equation used is applicable to population growth and if the conditions influencing population growth in Bengal over the period to which it has been applied continue substantially unchanged for the future  the estimates of total population made by use of the equations deduced should represent the population to be expected  The equation themselves suffer however by being fitted to so few observ^ed counts and the conditions influencing population growth cannot be predicted and are difficult to discover if a change in the cycle suggests their existence  Thus after the formation of the German Empire and the institution of the present constitutions in Japan  Pearl foimd that the cycle of growth was  as it were  speeded up and Germany and Japan starting from the population of that critical time took a leap forward and continued their cycle as if they had been at an earher stage when growth was more rapid  It is by no means impossible that constitutional change may have a similar effect in Bengal and may aSect the different communities to a difierent degree   Can Bengal support a population   The prospect or even the possibility of so considerable an increase in a population already one of the densest in the world may lead to apprehension that the population of Bengal is rapidly approaching numbers which cannot be sustained at any reasonable standard of hving upon the means of subsistence which Bengal can produce for long  If population actually does increase according to some such law as that illustrated by the logistic cur  e the fact that considerable Pearl himself has pointed out that this increases are inemtable makes the apprehension futile  inevitable increase need not necessarily increase the misery in the world since first this result has not happened up to the present  secondly “ the orderly evolution of human knowledge justifies us in assuming that science will keep pace in discovering means of expanding opportunities of happy human subsistence ”  and thirdly the human organism is itself adaptable to an extent not yet imagined  It carmot be denied that a large part of the population of Bengal lives at a verj  low level of subsistence  and that any increase of population must lead to increased What is suggested here is that distress unless the potentialities of the province are developed  these potentialities are such that pessimism as to the future condition of its population if considerable increase take place is not necessarily justified  Like the rest of India Bengal is notable for its undeveloped resources and the inefficiency with which such resources as it has are exThe soil is probably unlikely to deteriorate further and the general opinion about ploited  areas such as Bengal  where scanty manuring necessitates small crops  is that a dead level of yield was reached long ago and is conditioned by the rate at whieh plant food constituents are made available by weathering  The cultivator in Bengal practically never enriches the soil with any manure and the use of manures together with an improvement in the implements of agriculture which would then be rendered possible would probably increase enormously the output of the soil  It has been  estimated that improved methods would result in a reasonable expectation of increased food output of 30 per cent  throughout the whole of India  There is no doubt that any additional labour required under a more intensive form of cultivation could easily be obtained since the agriculturist in Bengal on the whole probably works less than agriSubsidiary Table I  Bengal Report  also shows culturists in almost any other part of the world  that of the total area cultivable only 67 per cent  is now actually imder cultivation  If the total cultivable area were brought under cultivation and if improved methods of cultivation yielding an increase of 30 per cent  over the present yield were adopted it is clear from a simple rule of three calculationf that Bengal could support at its present standard of hving a population very nearly twice as large as that recorded in 1931  Fresh areas in course of time will be brought under cultivation as lands on the Bay of Bengal accrete and reach a stage suitable for cifltivation  Even at present it is clear that by far the majority of the food stuffs consumed in Bengal are During 1930 31  taking only grains  pulses and flour  salt  sugar and spices  locally produced  provisions and oilman’s stores Bengal imported goods of the value of Rs  821 lakhs and exported goods of the value of Rs  281 lakhs  But the balance of trade during the same year amounted to Rs  34 52 41 lakhs or more than three times the aggregate export and import trade  The seaborne trade of Calcutta is not confined to goods originating in or meant exclusively for Bengal  but in the year 1930 1931 jute  tea and hides contributed 77^ per cent  of the total and Bengal contributed all the jutes  nearly all the hides and a very considerable part of the tea  It is consequently clear that the favourable balance of trade to a very small extent only was dissipated outside Bengal and that the balance itself provides sufficiently for an enormously increased importation of food Not only agriculture but also industry is at stuffs were it necessary to import them at any time  present in Bengal practically in its infancy  Reviewing production in India a Bengah writerj “ outstanding feature of the productive in 1924 came to the conclusion that the system of India •    G  Clarke  Proceedings

of resources on the one hand and the  It is insufficient production to which lower productivity of the industries on the other The lack of capital is partly responsible due India’s poverty  both absolute and relative be regarded as the fundamental but could not for the present low productivity production is the result of Insufficient India in production insufficient cause of inefficient labour  i e   lack of capacity on the pjart of the people to mobdise the physical  intellectual and moral forces of the country and to organise land and capital effectively for national Improvement in methods of production both agricultural and industrial should production therefore very easdy make possible the subsistence of such an increased population as is sugis  gested by the hgures already discussed  and the considerations deduced in this paragraph also make it possible to hope that such an increase of population may be attended with a very considerable increase in the material condition of the people and in the standard of hving  It is clear at least that it is not yet time to indulge  m gloomy forebodmgs on the grotmd that  Bengal is over popirlated  provided full use is made of the available resources of the country by improved methods   A final problem suggested by the growth of population in Bengal concerns the enormous ExtrangM wastage of hfe with which that gro^s th is achieved  It is clear that what is of importance in ^p^ui^on population growth is the rate of increment  A high rate of increment can be achieved by a increase are ® pracfleal relatively low birth rate if the death rate is also low  whilst on the contrary a comparatively low rate of increase results from even a high birth rate if the death rate also is high actually both the birth rate and the death rate in Bengal are very there is consequently an appalling wastage of reproductive energj’’ in maintainhigh and If the logistic theory of population grondh is correct a ing the present increase of poprdation  retarded rate of increase is inevitable at the upper stages of the cycle of growth until finally a population is reached which to all intents and purposes is stationary  France in Europe where there is a notoriously low birth rate probably illustrates this position best but an exhaustive  enquiry into the Arab population of Algiers suggested to Pearl that the retardation of the rate of increase is in general effected at the upper stages of the population growth by decrease both in the The Arab population of Algiers showed both a decrease in the birth rate and in the death rate  birth rate which could not be ascribed to any voluntary measures and a decrease in the death rate which equally could not be ascribed to improvement in public health measures since the traditional custom of the Arabs offer the utmost possible resistance to any changes in their habits which would improve sanitary conditions  Attempts to effect a retardation of the rate of increase by voluntary limitation of the birth rate are almost certainly doomed to failure particularly in Bengal  They are repugnant to common sentiment in this country  the methods adopted are so expensive as to be beyond the reach of the great majority of the inhabitants and it is probably true to say that there are as yet none which can be relied upon as being absolutely certain and satisfactory  I igures for the different strata of society show that there is no evidence to believe that contraceptive measures are used by the upper classes or those engaged in professions and the liberal arts and it is certain that they are not What appears to happen  if the analogy of Western practised at all in the lower strata of society  Europe may be accepted  is that a decrease in the death rate is inevitably followed at some period by a corresponding decrease in the birth rate  It is clear also that fertility in western countries decreases with the increase of wealth and intellectual interests  It is therefore possible to expect that a reduction of the birth rate by the adoption of improved measures of pubhe health accompanied by an improvement in the standard of living  an increase in the spread of education and perhaps principally by a further emancipation of women and their introduction to spheres of usefulness and activity from which they are now in Bengal generally debarred by social custom and by the institi lion ol purdah will in due course result in a decriasc in the birth iate corresponding wdth the decrease in ii e death rate whicli it is the object of public ealtii measures to    i  bring about  Biology of Popululion Grout t   \f1           CHAPTER II    44     IJRBAISr  AND RURAL   CHAPTER UrlsJii ^ Statistics  36  ol Urban  and Rural Popuiation   I   and R  us“al

an fiicrease in its proportion to the whole of 0 8 since 1921  That is to say 6 510 151 or 19 2% of the total increase of the population dining the past decade has taken place in towns  This increase is of course partly the natural increase of the pre existing urban population and parth’ occasioned 1  y migration from rural areas or by their incorporation into urban ones  while in estimatnig the growth of the urban population allowance must Lc made for the expansion of large oillages to a size or importance which causes them to be classified as tovm s  and likewise for the omission of

4 34 4  37 Of a necessity the definition of a town for census purposes has resulted in a distinction which is sometimes arbitrary  Towns of not less than 100 000 inhabit   ants were to be treated as cities  and also any other towns which the Superintendent decided to treat as cities subject to the sanction of the Local Government  But the Census Code further provided for the treatment as a town of every municipality  all civil lines not included in municipal limits  every cantonment and every other continuous collection of houses  inhabited by not less than 5 000 persons  which the Superintendent of Provincial Census Operations decided to treat as urban  in maWng this decision the Census Superintendent was instructed to take into consideration the character of the population  the relative density of the dwellings  importance in trade and historic associations  and to avoid treating as towns overgrown villages without urban characteristics  The edect of the latter provision is to be inferred from the marginal statement which shows that of a total of 2 575 Percentage places treated as of total Number  Popuiatiou  urban towns in 1931 population 600  or 23 3%  ^ 1921  1931

their inhabitants amount to onlv 4 122 088  or 10 6% of the urban population  which indicates the comparatively small size of these towns  There has been inevitably considerable  m  variation the latitude observed by census superintendents in the exercise of this discretionary power of classification  with the result that the varyin^^ de mees of urbanization of different provinces cannot necessarily be taken at their face value TLus Mysore appears as having a higher proportion of urban population than Madras  but 66 of its 108 towns have a population of less than 5 000 and if such towns be omitted altogether the position of the two units is reversed Similarlv both Bombay and the United Provinces have large proportions of their total urban population represented by the inhabitants of small towns of 5 000 inhabitants or In this connection it will be well to bear in mind that the less  distinction between a small town and a large village as far as the conditions of life or occupation of its inhabitants is concerned is often meaningless  and the treatment of anv place as urban rather than rural does not necessarily imply any degree of mdustrialization and only the minimum degree of a corporate life distinct from that of the ordinary  Definition of Urban   reas   \f       CHAPTER II   46 village     towms   URBAN AND RURAL   “ many of the non industrial to quote the Census Superintendent for Bengal from large villages  conditions their in little but differ  A comparison of an infrequent lamppost except in the provision of local selfspread of the indication gives some with the figures of last census    government   The greatest degree of growth has been in the number of towns with a population of from 20 000 to 50 000  the total population of which is now nearly double that of towms of 50 000 to 100 000 and not very much short of that of the 38 towns whose individual populations exceed 100 000  The number of towns has been increased at this census by the treatment of cantonments as separate entities instead Such inclusion may be of including their figures with that of an adjoining town  justified in the case of suburbs  civil lines and notified areas which are more or less dependent for their existence on the proximity of a town  but a cantonment may be and frequently is not only of entirely independent origin and a self contained unit  but actually indebted to the absence of a large urban population for the site chosen for occupation  IMoreover even w here it adjoins an old established urban area  the cantonment has a separate organisation and a corporate life of its own  Out of eighty  nine cantonments thirty  four have an elected board and thirteen a nominated board  the administration of the remainder being vested in a corporation sole All of these bodies have an executive officer usually pro  ided in the case of the more important ones by the Cantonment Department  In any case the cantonment depends for its indh idual and separate existence on causes which are foreign to those governing the grovdih ox decline of cities and towns  and it is Class and dcscri ition of  No  of towns in  town   class

reasons of economy in sorting  the available figures of internal migration are less detailed than in 1921  but the returns for tw elve cities show that  out of a total population of 3 670 261  as many a s 1 746 211  1 155 543 males and 590 668 females  or 48% of the total population  were bom elsewhere  the remainder being  the natives of their respective cities   This  of course  does not represent the actual  \fURBAN POPULATION   47  accretion from countries or towns  but indicates tbe maximum extent to which the population of urban areas is reinforced by immigration as distinct from natural increase  It is  of course  obvious that the composition of the truly urban population is likely to differ from that of the rural population of the surrounding area  It is in the nature of things that the more varied activities of towns should attract a mixed population with less homogeneity than that of the coimtry side  But beyond this  there appears to be a tendency for the population of towns in general to show different characteristics from those of rural areas It is naturally in certain definite directions  to be expected that the percentage of hteracy should be greater in towns  where opportunities for education are more readily available  and find that 10% of the total accordingly we literate population  and 29% of the total literate in English  is to be found in 38 cities  and the ratio of literacy to the total population is 27% in these 38 cities as against 8% in India as a whole  Figures for towms other than cities are not available but would probably much increase the ratio if they were  The corresponding percentages for literacy in English are 10 3 and 1 0%  In the case of infirmities  no separate figures for cities are available but the figm’es for Bengal go to indicate that those infirmities to record which an attempt is made at the C’ensus are not  W orse in cities than elsewhere  since the number of insane  for instance  returned from the Eajshahi Division was 6 142 as against 4 245 returned from the Presidency Division  Census figures for infirmities are  however  notoriously unreliable and it is not safe to draw any conclusions   39 The figures for sex and age in cities have    y  to be considered in the light of the common practice in India by which men leave their families in their homes in villages and go to earn their living as  temporary or semi permanent workers in towns  This naturally results in an excess of males of URBAN I93M mature age in cities and towns which is illustrated by the figures in Table I for urban and rural population  where the number of females to every 1  000 males is 815 in urban areas  and 957 in rural as compared to 941 for India as a whole  Urban Sex Similarly the mean

life  of  unnathe  latter sex in some of  the  greater  cities   which in the case of the men involves of course a corres   ponding number of  women left by them their homes  A comparison of the  in  figures     for  the provinces with those of 1921 indicates that there is nearly everywhere decrease from the 1921 ratio  a considerable The only provinces or states in which the urban female ratio shows an increase are Burma  the North West Frontier Province  Baluchistan  Travancore and Cochin  while  excepting Burma  the decrease in the major provinces has been heavy  On the other hand Bombay          which had 664 females to every 1 000 males in 1881  586 in 1891  617 in 1901  when the impermanent population Was depleted on account of the plague  530 in 1911 and 525 in 1921 had 554 in 1931  showing a fair fi ity  increase   probably due however   as  in 1901  to depletion of floating male labour  this time on account of the  depression in trade  In the accomdiagram the figures represent the total figures  including suburbs omitted in the table preceding it  In the more purely industrial towns such as those of Gujarat the ratio is much less unequal than in the cos   panying  mopolitan ports  It might be expected that decaying towns would show a rising female ratio  since such a town not only fails to attract immigrants but might be presumed to tend towards sending out male emigrants to earn an industrial living by some urban occupation elsewhere  The Census Superintendent of Bengal however has shown that the decaying towns of that province have a falHng female ratio  a phenomenon often to be associated with a decline in population in other parts of the world  but not apparently in India generally  In the case of cities which include cantonments allowance must obviously be made for the fact that a disparity in the numbers of the sexes is a necessary concomitant of the concentration of troops  In the main India tables however  that is in Tables III  IV and V  cantonments have been separately  shown and are not included Madras  in the figures for cities  though in the special  tables for cities from Table  VI  on   wards cantonments  etc   are generally included  Race and Reunion in Towns   ^  40  It was suggested in the Census Report for 1901 that there were possible connections between race and religion and the practice of congregating in towns   \fRACE AND RELIGION IN TOWNS   49  One of the reasons given for the comparative absence of the urban habit in Bengal was the presumption that its population contained a strong mongoloid element  and it was pointed out that the inhabitants of Assam and Burma  both much more mongoloid than Bengal  were even more markedly rural  It may  however  be questioned whether race has in this case anything to do with the matter  and we should be inclined to account for the phenomenon not by race but by rainfall  The areas of the greatest precipitation in the peninsula are the Malabar Coast  Bengal  Assam and Lower Burma  and if living in cities is unpopular  as it certainly is  in these regions it is perhaps rather on account of the greater degree of discomfort which it involves than on account of the racial composition of the people  The ^ population in at any rate two of these areas has an excessively high density  and one which easily compares with that of drier provinces of greater urbanization on the other hand it is spread  where it is thickest  through almost contiguous but rural habitations among coconut groves and rice fields  In northern India it is not impossible to five in a walled village or town and to move about freely on the face of the land during the greater part if not aU of the year  In Eastern Bengal or Cochin the heavens are overcast and the land is awash for nearly half the year  and man or beast can only roam in or on the face of the waters  a condition which makes sanitation and evaporation very much more difficult to obtain in closely agglomerated habitations than in scattered homes each in its own demesne  On the other hand in southern India the Tamil as distinct from the Telugu  Kanarese or Malayali does appear to be predisposed towards urban fife     It was further observed in 1901  though no explanation was suggested  that towns attracted population of different religions in varying degrees  and it was pointed out that whereas in Bengal  Baluchistan  Assam and the Punjab the Muslim took less readily to town fife than the Hindu  the case was reversed in most other parts of India  particularly in the United Provinces  the Central Provinces and Berar  in Hyderabad  Madras  Mysore and Rajputana  Clearly the reason has nothing to do with rehgion  Probably it is to be traced to historical causes  and it would appear  as might perhaps be expected  that the intrusive population is that which tends to prevail in the towns  Thus in Rajputana  Bombay  the Central and the United Provinces  and in southern India generally Hindus represent the country stock established before Islam appeared  and it is natural to find that on the land the Hindu still predominates  Conversely in Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Provmce the Hindu is nowadays iutrusive and we find that he tends there to congregate in cities  In the case of Burma both are intrusive  but the Muslim has shown a greater tendency to intermarry with the Burman and to settle locally  while many of the Mushms of Burma  Zerbadis and Yakaing Kalas  are more Burmese than foreign in descent  Consequently we find that the Muslim in Burma shows a greater tendency than the Hindu to leave the towns  The two provinces which at first sight appear to spoil this hypothesis are Bengal and the Punjab  Here  however  the inversion of the usual condition would seem to be due not to a breach of the rule that the intruder clings to the towns but to the fact that the country dwellers have been converted on a much larger scale than elsewhere  The Muslim of East Bengal and of the Surma Valley in Assam seems to be descended for the most part from converted inhabitants  and similarly conversion to Islam was probably imposed on the Punjab with more persistence and efficacy than in parts of India more remote from the course of Mus lim invasions and added later to the Mogul dominions  Apart from this the trading classes  which are often racial or religious  naturally tend to be town dwellers  so that Parsis and Jews can hardly be found elsewhere  and Jains  who include large numbers of the Marwari and Kathiawar  traders  are more urban than communities Thus too Sikhs who are rural at home are town dwellers of other faiths  elsewhere  whither they go generally as mechanics or artificers of some kind  It remains to be added that the figures of some urban communities in the Punjab may have been shghtly affected by intensive propaganda aimed at bringing rustics into the towns on census night to swell if possible the numbers of one electoral community or another  and one or two similar cases occurred in the United Provinces  Where this is alleged to have taken place  however  there seems to have been little or no change in the proportions borne by the community to another   The table below gives a summary of certain information with regard to that is with regard to those which have not less than 100 000 inhabitants   41 cities      Their figure is moderate enough when compared with those of the west  M22C C  cities   The Unitsd 1  \fCHAPTER II   60   URBAN AND RURAL   Kingdom alone is unfortunate enough to have 56 towns of over t his minimnin compared to India’s 39  while the United States of America have at least 70  though their population is only 123 mdhon  httle more than a third of India’s  The figures given in column 7 are not all strictly comparable one with another  as the definition of foreign born adopted by different provinces varies  Thus iu Calcutta the figure refers to those born outside Bengal  in Hyderabad and Lahore to those born outside the City but in Srinagar to those born outside the State  and in the case of eight other towns to born outside the District  ’  ‘  Total Population    City   per l

the above cities have more than 400 000 inhabitants  and these mil be mentioned severally below  Of the rest it must be pointed out that the figures for Ahmadabad are more or less conjectural  That city determined on a  \f1  CITIES   til  boycott of the census in conformity with the Congress programme and the opposition was so well organised that a complete census could not be taken  Like other cities in Gujarat it consists largely of pots  that is of blind alleys tenanted by a caste community having their own outer gate which afiords the o ^y access to the individual houses in that particidar block  These pdls shut and barred their doors on census night and defied the enumerators to enter  With the aid of police an entry was forced into many of the non  cooperating pdls  but even then the obstruction to and interference with the enumerators was continuous and most of the inhabitants remained out of doors in the streets  making the taking of a census impossible in many parts of the city  As it was  the census was carried out effectively in six out of 24 wards  In the other 18 wards the census was partially carried out with varying degrees of incompleteness  The total figures obtained by count were therefore much short of the total population figures given in Table IV  in which the figures formed represent a conservative estimate of the total population by sex  the actual figures obtained by enumeration appearing in Table V   The Ahmadabad Municipality have since taken a census of their own  in July 1932   and though the result cannot be officially recognized and came too late to make possible a revision of our 1931 estimate  there is no reason to suppose that it is not substantially correct and it is certainly more hkely to be accurate than the  estimate adopted for the India Tables municipal census is 382 768      the population figure according to the  The City of Calcutta includes the municipality of Calcutta  with the mihtary area of

the harbour  viz   Cross Island  Middle Ground  Oyster Rock and Butcher Island  Its area has increased by some 415 acres since 1921  as a result of the Back Bay reclamation  The census was taken by the Executive Health Officer  under the general supervision of the Census Superintendent  in circumstances of considerable difficulty on account of the civil disobedience movement  and showed a population of 1 161 383  The Bombay born population  which was only 16 per cent  in 1921  has gone up according to the figures of birthplace to 24 6 per cent   but there is some doubt as to whether the returns are accurate in this respect  On the other hand an increase was to be expected as a result of the absence of much of the periodic migratory population  Immigrants from Portuguese India number some 39 000  an increase of over 4 500  but Europeans have fallen from 13 544 in 1921 to 8 400 in 1931  1 009 of whom are non British subjects  This fall in number is largely but not entirely attributable to a reduction in the number of British troops  A very high proportion of the Bombay population  20 4 per cent   is drawn from the Ratnagiri District farther down the          As in other cities Rangoon for instance there is a disproportionate number of persons in the age groups from 20 to 40  and the female ratio  though coast   higher than at any census since 1901  is excessively low  being only 554 females to every 1 000 males  though the ratio in the city born population is 728  The percentage of literacy has increased from 23 to 24 only  but that of literacy in Enghsh from 8 to 11 6  The only industry conducted on any large scale in Bombay shipping  including both owners and employed  brokers  is that of cotton textiles •     mariners  boatmen  etc   only accoimts for 25 per mille of the total following occupations of all classes  The mean density of the Towm and Island in 1931 was 48 000 persons per square mile  a decrease on the density figure of 1921  probably to be accounted for by the absence in certain areas of the floating cold weather population owing to the trade depression  In most parts of the city  however  the density is very much greater than the mean figure  In the Kamathipura quarter it is 385 280 per square mile  in Isagpada II it is 407 040 and in the Kumbharwada quarter 465 280 persons per square mile  At least 36 per cent  of the population of the city suffer from gross overcrowding  Of all tenements 81 per cent  are one roomed and the average number of persons to each of those rooms is 4 01  but that gives little notion of the congestion at its worst  for 256 379 persons live in rooms occupied by 6 to 9 persons each  80 133 in roo ms of 10 to 19 persons each and 15 490 in rooms occupied by 20 or more persons to Figures of

is on the floor space of one roomed tenements in London”  Bombay is  therefore  to be congratulated that her population has at any rate fallen by 1 2 per cent  since 1921 probably the missing population    is  Madras   to be congratulated hkewdse   44 The growdh of the third presidency town has    in  the past been very  much slower than that of Calcutta or Bombay  There was some growth

covering together an area of over 39 sq  miles and containing a population which has increased by 52 5 per cent  since 1921 and now amounts to 429 747  of which slightly over 400 000 occupy the old walled city and the town 47     Inside the walled city there are 176 792 persons living The increase in population during the last at a density of 198 500 per sq  mile  decade has naturally taken place outside the walls  and a chain of dwellings now More than half the inhabitants were links the civil station to the cantonment   and civil station outside ^it      born outside the city  and

part of which is outside the former  The population has increased from 341 962 in 1921 to 400 415  but part of this increase is due to the extension of the city limits  and the increase since 1921 on the w hole area now included If the adventitious population numbering 22 31  at this census  is 15  9 per cent        and including the floating population of the port  inmates of jail  etc   be excluded at both censuses  the decennial increase becomes 17 7 per cent  The density of the The population is largely immigrant with city is 16 146 persons to the square mile  living at age groups 20 to 40 and in the numbers the in disproportion a consequent Thus of the Telugus in Rangoon  mostly unskilled ratio of females to males  labourers  two thirds are found in age groups 20 to 40  and there are only 20 females per 100 males  an inequalitv of ratio still more pronounced among Onyas with 7 and Chittagonians with 2 females to every IVipulatudi uf Hangooif  Of every 1 000 persons in JOO

outside Burma  while in the case of females on the other hand 750 pei mille Total 400 415 48 were Burma born  Owing to the small proportion of females to males for the whole population the deaths exceed the births by an amount  according to the  vital statistics  of about 46 000  so that the increase of 55 000 during the decade implies an immigration figure of 100 000 dining the same period  if the vital statistics can be trusted  The total female ratio has however been rising  being now 48 per 100 males compared to 41 in 1911  and the proportion of foreign born has fallen from 583 per mille in 1911 to the present figure of 509  males   IL’ 1 998  Rural Population   The  49  100 100  between a town and a village however arbitrary on a numerical basis  but the definition of the village as a unit is by no means ahvays so easy  As has ahead ’ been indicated  populated parts of the Malabar Coast and of Bengal are the thickly b ’ a  series of homesteads  often oecLq ied which may be grouped in villages for administrative j urpuses but w’hich do not thereby acquire any of ol the compacf the characteristics ileterminate village of Lpper India  leaving it difficult to say

thickest it is found in concentrated villages  as on the N  E  Frontier  whereas when very thin it seems to be spread about in isolated homesteads or scattered hamlets as in the Simla Hills  In Baluchistan  where a large proportion of the population is still more or less migratory  villages are becoming more scattered as the need for defence ceases to be felt  This indeterminate nature of the village unit  which may be a definite residential site  walled or palisaded  or may be an administrative unit containing several residential villages or a number of scattered houses  impairs the significance of the figures of the population as distributed in villages of various sizes  Population  for instance  shown as residing in a village of 2 000 to 5 000 persons may really be the population of a mauza containing several small residential villages of less than 500 persons each  whereas a number of villages of less than 500 may really be contiguous hamlets of scattered houses that might just as well be shown as one large village  Generally speaking  however  it may be said that of the total population of India 89 per cent is rural  more than half lives in villages with a population of under 1 000 and nearly one third   27 6 per cent  lives in villages with a population of under 500 persons   in the plains     village and it 50 Ambiguity has characterised the terms  ‘ town ’and house ’  The term house in India covers the attaches again to the term The portable screens of bamboo matting carried greatest diversity of dwellings  on a gipsy’s ass  or the camel borne tent of a Bugti nomad are less primitive than the mere foliage wind screens of some of the Andamanese but still hardly conforming to the usual conception of a dwelling house  though this term can fairly be applied to the conical grass huts of the Chenchu and the Bhil and still more to the thatched and matwalled dwellings  often on piles or in In Bengal the trees  erected in the hills alike of Assam and of Travancore  thatched roof is hogbacked to increase the resistance of the gables to the roofliftmg cyclone  while on the west coast the typical Nayar house has picturesquely cocked gables on a very steeply pitched tiled roof the better to resist the Indeed the houses of the well to do in Malabar are built round torrential rain  an open impluvium on to which a pillared verandah opens giving access to all the rooms  one of which is reserved as in an ancient Koman house for the lares and penates  In Upper India on the other hand  the mud wall and flat roof of a dry ‘  ’  Houses and     ‘  ‘  ’  climate prevail  while the rich surround their houses of brick or stone with a walled enclosure and ensure privacy by the greatest economy in windows  Almost everywhere the tendency is apparent towards tlie replacement of traditional roofing materials by corrugated iron sheeting as ugly as ubiquitous  If the house  may vary from the chaui dwelling of a large town to a sprawling  bari in the country  so too the family is a difficult unit to define iti correspondence Apart from the collective houses of some of the hill tribes which to the house  accommodate all the bachelors or spinsters of the village  a Bengal huri may house  a joint family of several married ccu  les in contrast for instance to the Assam hill custom whereby the elder sons  or in some tribes the elder daughters  set up new houses for themselves or  as in other cases  turn their parents out of the ancestral home to build a house for themselves elsewhere  It was therefore necessary to define the house for census purposes  since a house is far from being a constant unit and generally speaking a census house meant the buildings  several  one  or part of one  inhabited by one family  that is by a number of persons living and eating together in one mess with their resident dependants and their servants Even this wide definition proved difficult to apply residing in the house  universally  as it is defeated by the Santal  for instance  whose married sous have entirely separate establishments but resort to then father’s house for meals  1 the case of town houses it was general  Persons

URBAN AND RURAL   The coruparabilitv of the figures of different censuses is to some extent vitiated by changes in the definition of a house  as the structural definition adopted cliapter I   in 1872 has gradually given way to the  social one given above  but has not yet been uniformly accepted or rejected by all provinces and states   Pressure of Population  upon Housing   dwelling is not generally 51  It has already been indicated that city congenial to the Indian  and indeed since India is primarily an agricultural country it could hardly be expected that a high proportion of its population would be found in towns  The Census Superintendent for Mysore State quotes a Kanarese proverb “ after ruin go to the city ”  which is sufficiently expressive of the general disposition towards a town life  though it is somewhat typical of the Gujarati and of the Tamil to show a greater inclination towards a town races  It is however to the general absence of such life than most Indian an inclination and to the general absence of industrial acthdty that the slow grovdh of urbanization is to be imputed  There are only 39 cities of over 100 000 inhabitants in the whole of the Indian Empire  and the general growth of the urban population has been 20%  while 10% has been that of the rural  although the city of Bombay has actually decreased in population during the decade  On the other hand there has been a very rapid growth in some towns   While Calcutta has increased by 12 per cent   Rangoon by 17 per cent   Madras by 23 per cent   Karachi by 23 per cent  and several other cities by 20 per cent  or a little over  Patna has increased by 33 per cent   Delhi City by 40 per cent   Bangalore City by 45 per cent   Nagpur by 48 per cent   Lahore by 53 per cent  Amritsar by 65 per cent  and Salem by 96 per cent   The number of occupied houses has not generally increased in proportion to the population though that is not to say that it has not increased proportionately to the number of families  since much of the increase must have been counted in children  while in some cases  e g   Bangalore Ci ’il and Military Station  houses have increased at a greater rate than the population  At the same time there is very serious congestion in many towns  and the density of urban population is in some cases almost as excessive by western standards as is the density of rural population in the more fertile Thus the density of Belfast County Borough is 17 984 persons per areas  square mile  1926  and the average density of a London County Borough  1931  is 37 568 persons to the square mile  a density which reaches its maximum Leith  1931  has 35 000 persons per in Southwark with 97 088 to the square mile  square mile and the Govan ward of Glasgow  its most densely populated in 1931  has 36 230  With these figures we may compare  the densities of Lahore with 10 913 persons to the square mile  of Peshawar City with 22 830 and of Calcutta with 36 265 while half a dozen towns in the United Provinces  including the city of Moradabad  show a municipal density of from 40 000 to 45 000  Bombay has 48 000  Delhi City  Municipality  has 58 273  and Sikandrabad  a small town in the United Provinces  has 63 552 persons per square mile  But if smaller units be taken the densities found are much higher  Two fifths of the wards of Madras show a density of 64 000 persons to the square mile two thirds of Madura’s wards show a density of 64 000 and one ward that of 125 000 three wards of Peshawar have densities of 121 600  131 840 and 188 800 per sq  mile respectively the old walled city of Lahore contains a population of 177 000 persons living at a density of 198 500 per square mile  and although nine tenths of Lucknow shows a density of under 32 000  parts of the Yahiaganj ward of that town have a density of 423 000 to the square mile  The Kumbharwada quarter of Bombay has 465 280 persons to the square mile  In Cawnpore there is a sub 5tantial area with a density of over 100 000 and in Chak No  95 Talaq Mahal of Anwarganj ward in that city the density of 7SC 5C0 persons per square mile is reached              It is necessaj    in this connection to consider the size of families and the extent It must not be forgotten that houses to which they arc crov ded into single rooms  of more than two storeys are probably rather the exception than the rule in Indian urban areas  while even in towns one storied houses are perhaps even more plentiful than those of two  Thus of the total number of 24 579 structures in Baroda City 10 653 had one storey only  and those with more than two storeys numbered only 3 699  while of the houses in Bombay three in five have only one storey  and in Karachi 77 6%  The definition of a house must likewise be borne in mind  and this in urban areas generally depended on the existence of a separate entrance rather •  In both 1911 and i9k l pJague had caused an exodus from kSaiem   \f   PRESSURE OF POPULATION UPON HOUSING   57  than of a separate building  The average size of a family is a third important factor  This works out in Lucknow for instance at 4 6 persons but over 14 per cent  In Travancore the average of families were found to have 8 or more members  5 5 Eajputana it is 4 7  In Cawnpore household is and in number of persons in a 3 5 the presence of large but that is due to consists of only  the average family children at their homes v ives and workers who leave their industrial numbers of Industrial workers form a very small minority of the urban population  in villages  and it seems that taking India as a whole the average family contains from four  When therefore it is seen that in Delhi  for instance  the average number of persons per 1 000 houses varies according to the ward from 399 to 629 it seems likely that most families get a census house to themselves  Madras on the other hand has 877 persons per 100 houses  Rajahmundry 793  Mangalore 727  Madura 723  Vellore 709 and three more tovms more than the maximum average of any ward in Delhi  It is not possible that these figures should represent Of Madras itself  however  the Census a distribution of a house per family  Superintendent writes as follows to five individuals      “ A marked feature of Madras is the street dweller and squatter   A midnight tour of the  central and northern parts of the town any fine night would disclose sleeping persons on every  These persons are not all tramps by any means the majority indeed are ordinary Such a possession has no great i ilucemeut for a population of floating labour in a mild and pleasant climate  in a city where houses are The figure for Madras may be indicative of a higher number scarce and rents often exorbitant  of persons per dwelling than is desirable but before it could be taken as an accurate guide  the street dwellers and squatters would have to be deducted from the total population used in Madura’s figure involves to some extent a similar qualification  for to this striking the average  sacred city of the south wanderers resort in large numbers throughout the year ”  sidewalk      citizens in everything but the possession of a roof   It would be unsafe however to regard this factor as operative in the case of the other towns mentioned  though it is undoubtedly indicative of one factor which distinguishes overcrowding in the east from that in Britain  that is the greater extent to which an open air life is possible  since weather conditions which compel In Bombay the overcrowding retreat within doors are very much less prevalent  is so great that men have to sleep out wherever possible  and in the monsoon  when the pavement is impossible  verandahs  alley  ways and stairs are all crowded with slumberers   We have now to return to the census house   This is normally the dwelling  and in towns is usually determined by the existence of a it very often implies no more than a single room like one entrance  but

housing congestion in the Kolar Gold Field  from the Mysore State 256 300  26 4  15 500  79 000     Census Report     “ The standard size of a single room but is  generally speaking  9 feet by 9 feet

Cawnpore  •  By way of contrast to conditions in Bombay  Lucknow and Cawnpore the account of Jamshedpur given by the Census Superintendent for Bihar and Orissa is worth quoting    “ The industrial city of Jamshedpur is quite unlike any other city or town in the province  To all intents and purposes Jamshedpur town of the Comjjany  owned and administered by them  and its people enjoy the benefits of thi s highly efficient municipal government without paying any rates whatsoever  The town is administered through a Board of Works  consisting of representatives of the Steel Company and subsidiary companies  with two members of the general public and  or indeed in the whole of India is  a proprietary     the funds required for maintaining  the municipal services   such as roads  water supply  sewage  street lights  hospital ^  schools  etc   are contributed by these companies in fixed proportions about Rs  40 000 by the subsidiary concerns and the rest by Tata’s Among the more important developments of the last ten years  brief mention may be made of  The fuMa quarters built by the Company for its employees have doubled number  from 2 756 to 5 483  while the houses and huts constructed by the employees and others have increased from 400 to 8 150  The supply of filtered domestic water is three times as great as it was in 1921  and there are now 60 miles of water mains and 56 miles of drainage sewers  Provision for medical relief has been extended and improved  and in the mam nt  pital there is at present accommodation for 140 indoor patients as against 42 at the beginning of the decade  In addition to the formerly existing high school and primary schools  three middle English schools and 22 other schools have been opened Since tlie previous census was taken  the population of Jamshedpur has grown from 57 360 to 83 738 an increase of no less than 46 per cent This city furnishes a striking contrast to other urban units of the province  There is no congestion in Jamshedpur  and special care is taken to prevent the growth of slums and unhygienic bazars  Although the number of houses has increased by 100 per cent  since 1921  there are still less than 1 000 house s per square mile  whereas in the other three cities the average is over 2 000  And the number of persons occupying each house is exceptionally low in Jamshedpur ”  the following  in     This however is a solitary case and though there are Improvement Trusts in the larger cities they have much to do before they can do away with congestion  liTcreover India differs from Europe in that conditions of overcrowding are  \f1  1  PRESSURE OP POPULATION UPON HOUSING  probably as bad or worse in villages   The marginal figures for England and Wales in 1921  Percentage of families

by no means sure however that the worst specimens of housing in the presidency  do not come from certain rural areas  notably the wealthy delta tracts on the circars coast and Where land is dear  housing tends to be bad and land fetches a notable value in Every foot of ground is grudged to the village site delta districts where irrigation is assured  and even a comparatively weU to do landowner will exist in an almost squalor that surprises the If this is so with an actual owner of land it can be imagined what is the condition of stranger  In Tanjore  the farm labourer who in many cases also belongs to the so called depressed classes  these last form the backbone of the agricultural labouring population and are even yet little removed from a state of agrestic serfdom  One of the most commendable and valuable activities of the Madras Labour Department during the decade has been the compulsory acquisition of sites on which houses could be built for these people and they be introduced to something approaching decent conditions of livelihood In every country poverty and bad housing go together  This is so in India but a further element enters by the presence of the depressed classes  These people are forced in the villages and often even in towns to live Its site is rarely the most attractive and space is grudged  Little interest in a hamlet apart  is taken in the community and its habitat is rarely visited  A lack of public spirit or ordinary hopefulness is an almost inevitable consequence of such treatment and this added to the other elements tending to produce squalor has the result that the paracheris of this presidency may safely be counted upon to produce its worst examples of bousing  in Tanjore   ‘  ’  \f71S                              CHAPTER

Thus units  small of 41% high it is generally in tbe case and Ajmer Merwara 19  while in Ajmer city itself there are nearly as many immigrants as there are native born  In both these cases tbe migration is tbe natural result of a movement of labour  towards an urban unit  tbe high rate shown by Two other provinces Delhi being tbe result of its new growth as a capital city  Coorg with 24%

labourers to plantations naturally population is of the large part where a Baluchistan of highest rate is that Burma gains 5% by immigrants and Bihar and Orissa loses 4% migratory  as emigrants mostly to Assam  after which the percentages fall to about 3% of emigrants in the United Provinces and Madras  It was pointed out by Mr  Jacob in 1921  Punjab Census Report  Chapter III  that it can be shown mathematically that the smaller the unit of population the larger the proportion of persons born elsewhere  and in estimating the significance of migration it is necessary to bear this India

balance of migration being against India     •     Mature of ml^ratioii   54 Internal migration is of several kinds  for which the following convenient Casual migration  has been used in previous census reports  involving minor movements between neighbouring villages  largely by way of marriage  only affects the Indian figures when the boundaries crossed happen to be those of provinces or states  Temporary migration is mainly due to the movement in the demand for labour e g  on canals or public buildings  and to pilgrimages and Periodic migration is that caused by recurring seasonal demands  as for fairs     terminology  Semi permanent migration is that of persons who maintain their connection with their pre migration homes  earning their hving elsewhere but  harvesters   \f63  CASUAL  PERIODIC AND TEMPORARY MIGRATION   ultimately returning and often leaving their wives and families at home during the period of migration  Permanent migration is that in which the mi^ant leaves one place to settle in another for good  It is necessary also at this census to mention an additional form of migration which may be described as Daily  55   As already indicated casual migration is largely associated with marriage   Born in Punjab British Territory and enumerated in Delhi Rural Areas   Born in Delhi Province and enumerated in Gurgaon  Rohtak and Karnal Districts of

Temporary  is  illustrated  by migration   Census the Super  n t e ndent  for  Delhi  the  and  Punjab in  the  marginal table which shows the exchange of wives between Delhi and neighbouring districts in the Punjab  It might be expected that under the circumstances volume exchanged by adjoining provinces would balance  but this is not the both the since low ratio of women to men in the north west and the the case combined with a decrease in social status from west to east of hypergamy practice results Hindus of many castes in a surplus movement of women westwards  among the numbers both sexes born in the United Provinces and whereas of Thus enumerated in Bihar and Orissa are of corresponding proportions the numbers born in Bihar and Orissa and enumerated in the United Provinces show a great preponderance of females  Similarly females born in the United Provinces and enumerated in Rajputana greatly outnumber the males  It does not appear  however  that the United Provinces give any excess of females to the Punjab as might be expected  There are possibly historical reasons for this  Periodic migration is particularly heavy at harvest time and also at the changes of season when traders  graziers  herdsmen and labourers from Kabul  Baluchistan  Kashmir  •  and the hills generally move down to the plains for the winter months returning to the hills for the hot weather  when the movement is increased by the addition of plains dwellers moving up to escape from the heat or to profit by the accumulation As regards temporary migration the 1931 census of people in hill stations  was fortunate in avoiding coincidence with pilgrimages and fairs on a large scale  but the immigration figures of the Central India Agency are probably affected to the extent of a few hundreds by the Khajuraho fair in Chhatarpur State and the Garahet cattle fair in Khilchipur State  In Central India again there was some periodic migration on account of harvesting  which had been begun by the census Temporary migration date  and the same in the case of the Central Provinces  continues throughout the year  and some idea of its volume may be obtained from the figures of encampments in Table III  In the case of Bombay a considerable volume of temporary migration to Baroda State was political in nature and accounted for by raiyats in parts of Bombay adjoining Baroda who made an exodus across the State boundary on account of the Civil Disobedience movement in Gujarat  The number of these as they were called  amounted to 26 755 persons from 244 villages in Bombay Presidency  Some formed fresh hamlets on Baroda land  some occupied vacant sites in Baroda villages and others stayed Many of them  332 males and 1 339 as guests in the homes of their acquaintances  females  had actually been born in Baroda State  and the distances covered in this hijra were of the shortest  The very great majority had returned to their villages in British territory within the year following the census  56  Semi permanent and permanent migration are of more importance and semi permanent are most conveniently examined by those individual provinces where the volume       The table on page 64 gives the principal figures of the balance is considerable  migration as compared with 1921 and they are illustrated graphically in the map opposite it  Of the semi permanent migration between provinces the most important has been that to Burma from JIadras  Bengal and the United Provinces  The non permanent nature of this movement is shown by the small number of females as compared to males  Before the census actually took place a very large number of the Indians in Burma returned to their ovTi provinces on accovmt of the anti Indian riots in Rangoon and the general hostility long entertained towards Indians but evinced throughout Burma in 1930 in action as well as in Even so the census showed in Burma an excess of 751 595 immigrants feeling  over emigrants  an increase of 21  000 on the 1921 figure  Of these immigrants  \f          ^MIGRATION   CHAPTER III   64  38% come from Madras  Bengal  20%  the next  contributing  highest quota   and the United Provinces 11%  Of all the immigrants to Burma less than 1 in 5 are women  thus reducing Burma’s natural excess of females to a deficiency  Similarly in Assam  but to a far smaller degree  male immigrants reduce the female This reduction in the case of Assam ratio which is however deficient to start   dth  is slight  since male immigrants are to female immigrants as 4 to 3 only  indicating the much more permanent nature of the movement  which leads to large numbers of tea garden coolies taking up land and settling permanently after leaving the gardens  and which is also in a great degree a migration of Muslim cultivators from Bengal who bring their families with them  Assam’s excess of immigrants over emigrants is 1 335 627  of which 41% comes from Bengal  34 from Bihar and Orissa  2 of which are from the Bihar and Orissa States  6 from the Central Provinces  including 1% from the Central Provinces States  5 from the United Provinces  4 from Madras  principally from the Agency Tracts  and 2 from Rajputana  No other pro sdnce has anything approaching this figure of immigration  but Bihar and Orissa have an even larger figure of emigration  the net adverse balance The bulk of this goes to Bengal  65% of the gross emigration  being 1 248 293  Assam getting 27% and the Bihar and Orissa States over 10%  The United Provinces emigration figure is nearly as high as that of Bihar and Orissa  but the corresponding immigration figure is higher  and the adverse balance is 997 846  Bengal again getting 22%  Bombay 9% and the Punjab 1 5% of the gross emigration  which is much more evenly distributed between various pro^^nces and states than that of most provinces with a high emigration figure  The same applies to Madras    868 036 net  once the higher figures of emigration to Burma  26%  and Mysore  26%  are excluded Travancore and Hyderabad come in for the next and 12% respectively  The Punjab highest shares of Madras emigration with has an adverse balance  a considerable proportion of its emigrants going to Bombay  Bengal and Bombay both have high figures of migration  possibly on account of their large Presidency towns  but the balance is in their favour 899 274 in the case of Bengal and 658 267 in that of Bombay  Bengal’s immigrants include some 250 000 Nepalis  and 13 557 Europeans 66% of whom were foimd in Calcutta Bombay’s include 170 085

immigration is generally speaking of the permanent t3rpe  There have however been some changes and developments since 1921  particularly in respect of the volume of migration from provinces which formerly supplied the tea garden labour  Madras is the only province showing any increase in emigration to Assam  and there has been an extraordinary decrease in emigration from Bihar and Orissa to Assam  though the actual number of persons  Assam   enumerated on tea gardens has increased by some 60 000  Recruitment to Assam from Bihar and Orissa and elsewhere fell off rapidly after 1921  and in the United Provinces  at any rate  it is stated that emigration to Assam has become unpopular “ largely as a result of a deliberate campaign against it by non co  operators in the Recruitment from Bihar and Orissa began to revive early part of the decade ”  however in the last half of the decade largely as a result of short term recruitment under which a cooly is brought up to Assam for a year or so and then sent back to Or to quote the Census Superintendent of Bihar and Orissa  “ the his home  increase in the number of emigrants from 1927 28 onwards is attributed largely to ”  the popularity of the system of recruitment for short terms of 6  9 or 12 months The introduction of this short term system assisted by cinema propaganda is clearly changing the permanent nature of migration to the Assam tea gardens   Moreover the need for immigrant labour is less than it was  There has been a steady increase in labour obtained locally and lost by transfer  indicating greater freedom and fluidity  During the last five years adult labour bom locally has increased by over 50% and some gardens have taken to sending out motor lorries to bring in labour from the On the other hand the whole complexion of the population of Assam is villages  being altered by the permanent immigrants from Mymensingh in Bengal  This has for years been an ob^dous and disturbing change to all residents in the Assam Valley and it will be best to quote the Census Superintendent for Assam himself    “ Probably the most important event  m the province d’oring the lasr twenty five years  an  event  moreover  which seems likely to alter permanently the whole  ut are of Assam and to destroy more surely than did the Burmese invaden j of 1320 the whole straciure si Assam Jse culture and civilizatiou  has been the hivasion of a vast horde of hrid huagry Bengali immigrants    n5itly Muslims  from rhe districts of Eastern Bengal and in particular from nlymensingh  This invasion began sometime before 1911  and the census report of that year is the first report which makes mention of the advancing host  But  as wo now know  the Bengali immigrants censused or rather for the first time on the char lands of Goalpara in 1911 were merely the advance guard By 1921 the first army corps the scouts of a huge army followuig closely at their heels  had passed into Assam and had practically conquered the district of Goalpara ”        The Assam Census Report of 1921 describes Goalpara as inhabited by these 20% of its population  and Nowgong to 14% and describes parties of these settlers as invading the Assam Valley by   almost every train and steamer ”  Since then these settlers have not refrained from breeding and tjieir progeny being born in Assam is not distinguishable in the Census returns  except in so far as it is predominantly Muslim which the indigenous population is not  The rate of increase As to the change at this in the Muslim population of Assam since 1881 is 111%  settlers to  census the Census Superintendent may again be quoted           “ I have already remarked that by 1921 the first army corps of the invaders had conquered Goalpara  The second army corps which followed them in the years 1921 1931 has consolidated their position in that district and has also completed the conquest of Xowgong  The Barpeta Buh division of Kamrup has also fallen to their attack and Darrang is being iuva led  Sibsagar has so far escaped completch  but the few thousand Mynretisiiighias in North Lakhimpur are an outpost which may  during the next decade  prove to be a valuable basis of major operations  Where there is waste land thither flock the Mymensiughias  In fact the wav in which they have seized upon the vacant areas in the Assam Valley seems almost uncMiiuv  Without fuss  without tumult  without undue trouble to the district revenue staffs  a population which must amount to over half a million has transplant eel itsolt from Bengal to the Assam Valley the only thing I can compare it to is the mass during the last twenty five years  movement of a large body of ants ” Goalpara district there is little room left for expansion in the Kamrup where their immigration is new since 1921  there lias been an enormous increase of settlers causing the population figures to increase by 69% in Barpeta sub division since 1921  In Uari’ang district also they are rapidly taking up any In Kowgong district alone IMjTuensiaghias occupied 33 405 available waste land  acres in 1920 21  and in 1929 30  102 363 acres  Mushms having 89 078 and

Eeserves or forcibly occupying the land of local people  from which they are not evicted without 13 285 acres   They are however excellent agriculturists and most industrious  and they spend money freely  at any rate on litigation   difficulty   “ The exact miinher of the se Eastern Bengal settlers  including their children born in Assam   who are at present living in the Assam Valley is a difficult matter to estimate   Mr  Lloyd in  1921 estimated that including children born after their arrival in this province the total number As far as I can judge the number at present must of settlers was at least 300 000 in that year  be over half a million  The number of new immigrants from Mymensingh  alone  has been 140 000 and the old settlers have imdoubtedly been increasing and multiplying  As pointed out in the Census Report for 1921 the colonists have settled by famihes and not singly  This can be seen from the fact that out of the total of 338 000 persons born in Mymensingh and censused in Assam over 152 000 are women  What of the future   As far as can be foreseen the invagionis by no means complete It is sad but by Uo means improbable that in another thirty years Sibsagar district will be the only part of Assam in which an Assamese will find hiuuself at  home ”   There is yet a third class of immigrant in Assam  the Nepab  but the Nepab immigrant is fortunately decreasing in numbers  and the increase of Nepalis at this census has fallen from 89 to 36%  The decrease is attributed to action taken by the Nepal Government to discourage the emigration of its subjects  At the same time they are inconveniently numerous in the Khasia Hills where “ in the interests of the Khasi population some measures appear necessary to prevent any further expansion of Nepali colonization ”  Bihar and Oriasa   58  Bihar and Orissa is among provinces the antithesis of Assam in the matter It is typical of the rest of India in the general immobility of its population  and 959 persons in every 1 000 were bom in the district in which they of migration   were enumerated  while 931 in ever ^ 1 000 were enumerated in the district in which they were born on the other hand it has a higher emigration figure than any other proffince  from which the general standard of Indian migration  or rather the absence thereof  may fajrly be judged  The net loss to the province by emigration is 1 758 000  and if British districts alone be taken the loss is considerably greater as the Feudatory States receive twice as many migrants as they send out  and their immigrants are mostly from the British districts of the same province  As in the case of Assam however a change is taking place and the loss by emigration is considerably less than it was in the previous decade  Emigrants have decreased by 197 000 and immigrants have increased by 79 000  and to this has contributed not only the development of urban and industrial areas within the province and the consequent attrition of settlers from outside  but the economic conditions of the proffince  which tow ards the close of the decade compared favourably with the con   ditions in other produces more severely affected by the industrial depression  The latter cause has also operated to reduce the periodic emigration from the province   which is of very great volume and importance and is at its highest at the time of the The loss sustained by emigration therefore is not by any means a percensus  manent loss of the volume indicated by the figures  since much of it returns when the periodic migration is over at the time of the spring harvest or at the beginning of the monsoon  Over tw’o thirds of the emigrants from Bihar and Orissa were enumerated in adjacent provinces and perhaps the great majority of these return Of the remainder 95% are found in Assam  and here again to their homes later  the new  system of short term recruitment for tea gardens involves the inference that recent emigrants belong merely to the semi permanent class and will ultimately return to their province   United Provinces   59  In the case of the United Provinces  wffiich has the next largest volume of emigration  this volume of emigration  in contrast with that from Bihar and Orissa  The emigrants instead of decreasing has increased by a net balance of 158 000  are on the whole comparatively evenly distributed to all parts of northern and eastern India  though Bengal gets three times the share of any other province  Bombay  the Central Provinces and the Punjab standing next  while Rajputana conversely sends back more than it receives   but the bulk of this migration is of the semi permanent description and is described as a blessing to the province since  \fMADRAS   67  relieves the pressure on the soil and will be automatically absorbed within the province by any industrial expansion that takes place  it  60  Madras  the third highest province in order of net loss by emigration  is another which calls for some separate treatment  as the bulk of its emigration differs from that of other provinces in being overseas  Here the efiect of the worldwide industrial depression is seen in the foreign birthplaces returned in Madras as a result of repatriation  There has been a general increase in the number of persons born in Burma  Ceylon  Mauritius and Natal  E^ en so the 1931 figure shows a very marked increase in emigi ation to Malaya as well as in emigration to other parts of India  The overseas migration to Mala va and   evlon  which is 94 to 95% Madrasi  is treated in another paragraph  but it may be pointed out here that emigration from   ladras is not restricted to assisted emigration under the Act of 1922  which controls the departure of any persons from British India who are assisted by any person other than a relative  that is of persons recruited by agen^ ies  but also of a considerable quantity of the natural migration of persons who go and return as they please  and in this connection the Census Superintendent points out that “ it is possible for an emigration habit to arise not necessa rily connected with financial or seasonal stress at home  This imdoubtedly exists in South India  and the Circars coast touching the emigration movement to Ceylon  iMalaya and Burma ”  The area that suppbes Assam and Burma is generally speaking not the same as that from which emigration to  Malaya and Ceylon takes place  “ the The latter is a Tamil movement the emigrants to Burma are Telugus Burmese emigration is largely a Circars phenomenon and Burmese development has had a profound influence on the Telugu coastal districts To this the presence of 297 543 Madrasis in Burma at the time of the census testifies in spite of the largely increased number who had returned as a result of the anti Indian riots in May 1930  after which the volume of return continued so steadily that in May 1931 it was still 40% above that of the year before  Emigration to Assam again is neither Tamil nor  Telugu but mainly Bawara from the Yizagapatam Agency tracts  and showed a great increase from 1925 27 as a result of the enforcement in the Sawara maUahs of a policy of forest reservation  Later when the application was mitigated emigration decreased  and recruitment is nou  of the short term variety  repatriation after two years being guaranteed  ‘      Hadras   ’     61  In the Central Provinces the Census Superintendent detects the gro vth of what may be described as Daily ^Migration  In England and Wales a column to show the place of work was included in the schedule in 1921  but though such a daily migration is famihar enough in Bombay and in Calcutta where 20 000 living  Daily  MigratiM   outside the city travel in daily by train alone  to say nothing of those who use cars  buses or trams  in India generally the conditions imder which the residence of the worker and the place at which he works are so far apart as to form different census units have hardly yet arisen to an extmt to jiistify a column in the schedule  Nevertheless in some industrial areas it is already becoming a common practice for persons to li  e outside the  flace of employment aud to visit it every dav  This is apparent in Nagpur  for instance  where in some cases clerks live even 25 to 30 miles away at Ramtek and come in by train to their work  W cry morning  Similarly industrial settlements outside the town provide workmen who come in daily  The ’ buses rim to neighbouring villages for labour by Assam tea gardens have already  been mentioned   The Census Commissioner for Travancore State reports that daily migration is now a common feature of important toivns like Trivandrum  Nagercoil  Quilon and Alleppey  and the  Vnsus Superintendent Lor D  lhi estimates the average volume of daily migi ation tlu oughout the year between Shalidara and Delhi city  a matter of 3 or 4 miles only  at 1 500 persons  Q2  In 1921 the balance of migration as between British and State territory was against the States and in fai our of British India  but this position has been  reversed during the decade  possibly on account of the increasing pressure on the less thickly populated areas which are mostly in State territorv  Whereas the net loss to the states in 1921 was 124 000  in 1911 it had been 132 000   in 1931 the states gained 490 935 from British India  In spite of this there has been very little change in the du ection of migration betv een the States and British territory  since all those states which gtiined on the balance in 1921 have contimn d to do so except Gwalior  where the Census Commissioner of the State attributes  ‘to the dislocation in trade and the general financial stringency ” the eV M22CC

otherwise  and producing annually cane worth Demands for repatriation have declined very marfifty or sixty lakhs of rupees  kedly  having fallen from 1 180 in 1926 to 502 in 1930 During the decade

maybe specified by the Governor  General in Coimcil  whose notification under the Act must be approved by both chambers of the legisThe quantity of skilled labour which emigrates is very small and is

end to the emigration of unskilled labour to any place outside the Indian Empire except Ceylon and Malaya  Even to British Guiana  where the climate is not unhke that of Ceylon  and where the officer  Sir Maharaj Singh  deputed to report on conditions found that the conditions of education  of medical assistance and of the standard of hving generally were higher than those of rural India and that no political disabilities of any kind attached to Indian settlers  emigration  stopped on account of mortah   ty on the voyage many years ago  has not been renewed  Erom South Africa the tendency has been rather for a return to India  which is assisted by the Union Government by a bonus of £20 per adult and £10 per child  with free passage and free railway fares at each end of it  Thus while 791 emigrants from S  Africa returned to Madras and Calcutta in 1930  1 707 returned to these ports in 1931  The total number of Indians returning from S  Africa to India in 1931 was 1 961 more than half  988  of whom were colonial born  The general position therefore is that in spite of a rapid and heavy increase in population during the decade there has been even less rehef by emigration than in previous periods  Malaya and Ceylon   65 The two most important countries for Indian emigration at present are Malaya and Ceylon  as indicated above  Recruiting of Indian labour to Malaya was stopped in August 1930 on accoimt of the fall in tin and rubber  and the considerable repatriations have been already mentioned  None the less the 1931 census of British Malaya found 624 009 Indians in that

952females   In the case of Ceylon recruitment of Indian labour for rubber estates was stopped in 1930  but otherwise emigration continued  though it appears that the absorption of Indian labour in that country has nearly reached the saturation point  Net emigration India to Ceylon  Excess departures  The marginal table shows the net figures of Indian imExcess returns migration into Ceylon  that is the balance of arrivals over  1“ 38 530 1923 1931  A complete census of 1923 departures  from 20     413 226  55 55 and over        8 875       97 865   72 382   40 481   71 917   40 116   3 867  7

are obviously of Indian races including “ Afghans ”  a term used in Ceylon for Balochis  and about 50 Burmans  Enumeration by religion was Likewise incomplete  even for such figures of Indians as  we have  but it is easy to allot the different classes of Indians to their main reUgions Indians in Ceylon 1931   r Religion   Hindu Buddhist  Muslim Christian  Other  Persons   Males   Females   743 326

important Indian elements in Ceylon after the Tamil labour population are Malayahs  of whom Cochin and Travancore States contribute  some 2 500 and 4 000 respectively  Nattukottai Chettiyars  Bohras  Baluchis  Mappillas and Memons  about 500 Bengalis  and 200 Parsis  but 95% of the whole Indian population in Ceylon are Tamils  in round numbers 739 000  Total     778 170  426 715  351 455  Some idea of the economic value to India of the emigration to iVIalaya may be gathered from the fact that land held by Indians in the Straits Settlements alone was estimated as worth Rs  2 45 01 059  Savings Bank deposits held by Indians in Malaya amounted at the end of 1931 to the equivalent in dollars of Rs  35 58 614 an average of Rs  146 per depositor  while remittances by Indians from Malaya to India durmg 1931 came to a total of Rs  38 83 065  an average of Rs  69 per  \fINDIANS ON THE HIGH SEAS   71  In Ceylon however the indebtedness of Indian labour is a troublesome problem still unsolved  Emigrants returning in 1929 from Fiji  Mauritius and Trinidad combined brought back a total of Rs  5 11 147 between 2 174 men  women and children  working out at over Es  234 per head  children included   remittance   66 An attempt was made at this census to obtain a return of Indians on the High Seas outside Indian waters through the masters of the vessels on which they were passengers  A census of persons on ships is a familiar undertaking to most masters  and the Port officers at the larger ports were given special forms with instructions to issue them to a ll vessels shipping crews in Indian ports within the six months before the census  and the masters were requested to return the schedules from the first port touched after February 26th  1931  The numbers ultimately returned in this way to the ports of Rangoon  Calcutta  Bombay  Karachi and Aden amounted to 12 540 of which i22 represented females  The returns received in Madras proved to come entirely from Indian waters and were therefore not treated separately from the port population  In Bombay and Karachi returns came from outside Indian waters  but were amalgamated in the provincial totals  The majority of the returns were received through Calcutta and Rangoon they were not amalgamated in the provincial totals and do not    Indian  on the High Seas      appear as part of the population of India but are given separately here together with the returns that came through Bombay  Karachi and Aden  which should  strictly speaking  have likewise been separately treated  These returns will be found in Appendix II to the Tables Volume where they have been arranged in a series of forms corresponding to the Imperial Tables   The following points are worth notice  Nearly half the Indians enumerated on the High Seas came from Bengal and nearly a quarter from Assam the remaining quarter or more represented the United Provinces  Bombay  Punjab and other provinces in that order  but as a matter of fact the numbers hailing from French and Portuguese India  mostly of course Goanese  totalled rather more than those who came from the Punjab  Figures for age and civil condition were available only on the Calcutta and Rangoon schedules  and a great majority were naturally aged from 20 40  A majority of them were marvied  but  as might be expected  even among those over 20 marriage was much less universal than on land  In the matter of occupation they were mostly of course shown under the heading Transport by Water ’  but the large numbers having a subsidiary occupation in cultivation are noteworthy  Most of them  of course  are lascars  who are also cultivators in Bengal or Assam  Well over a quarter of the total are literate  but less than 1 per cent  are literate in English  In languages more than half have Bengali as their mother tongue and the next most predominant language • is Hindustani  and these two languages also predominate among the subsidiary languages spoken  Returns of language  however  are only available  as also in the case of literacy  from the Calcutta and Rangoon schedules  In religion a great majority are Muslims from whatever port the return is obtained  Among Hindus the predominant caste is that of Kharva  a sea faring caste in Cutch and          the neighbourhood   67 As will be already clear the Indian commimities in other parts of the British Empire are no longer reinforced by any emigrants from India except the very sm all numbers of skilled workmen who come and go to them  Strictly  therefore thev are outside the scope of Indian emigration as well as of the India census  But as their numbers are likely to be of interest to their fellow country men such figures as are available  mostly from British Colonial census returns of 1930 or 1931 have been tabulated in the appendix to the India Tables  In the Union of S  rkfrica there are about 165 500 Indians of whom 142 979 are found in Natal  In Kenya    there are 26 759 Indians the other overseas Indian communities in order of size are ^lauritius  268 870  Trinidad and Tobago 138 667  British Guiana 130 540  Fiji 75 117  Tanganyika 23 422   Jamaica 17 599

Bohras from Baroda doing business in Bilbao  iMalaga and in other to vn3  The Imperial Indian Citizenship Association records ap pi oximately 20 000 Indians resident outside the British Empire in addition to the foreign countries for which details are given here  It mil therefore probably be safe enough to say 20 238 for elsewhere  making a total of Indians resident ovemeas of approximately 2 404 000 so that a roacfh st^ement of two and a half million is not likely to be far from the truth  Tanganyika Jamaica                                                 Emigration has a perceptible

IV  Age  The return oi age   63  The returns of age will be foxxnd tabulated by sex and civil conTable VII gives dition in Tables VII and VIII of part II of this volume  particulars for the whole population by annual groups from 0 to 6 and thereafter in quinquennial groups for India and for pro ’inces and states separately  followed  by tables for cities in decennial groups   Table VIII gives returns for selected castes as first sorted into alternate ternary and septenary groups without the adjustment applied to the ages in Table VII  The enumerators at the 1931 census ^ere instructed to record age not as hitherto in terms of the number of years completed but as age at the nearest birth day  The discrepancy which on the face of it would he involved between the figures of the 1931 and aU previous Ignorance of precise age is almost unicensuses is more theoretical than real  is probability that the returns of age given at the 1921 the India and versal in as nearly the return   of age for the nearest were just censuses previous and the In fact it is the belief that the age birtli day as the returns of completed years  obtained by the enquiries made at previous censuses is more likely to have represented age to the nearest birth day than the number of completed years  that has caused the change in the instructioJi s to enumerators  In any case the Indian age returns are admitted on all hands to be extremely inaccurate  and even if the practice of recording as nil the ages of infants under six months  which the return of age at the neare st birth day involves  be regarded as an absurdity  it is certainly no worse than the conflicting instructions of previous censuses under which  1  all children under one year were returned as infants and  2  all children whose names could not be stated were likewise returned a s infants  A taboo on children s names is a common thing in India  but it is by no means one which ceases whoa the child reaches one year of age and the result at pre aous censuses has been  whether or no caused by this instruction  greatly to sw ell the numbers of infants under one year of age at the expense of infants over one year  an inflation which survivors of births occurring is liable to be increased by the addition of the between the preliminary and final enumeration  a space of time which may vary from a day or tw o to as much as a couple of months  This latter inflation is  tiowever  a reemrent feature of the Indian census and the comparative value The misstatement of the age of infants of the figui es from 0 1 is not affected  naturally appears at its maximum in the ages from 1 2  as indeed would appear to have been the case iu 1911 in the United Kingdom also  while there is comparatively little understatement of the ages of children of 2 3 years  and from three to five the tendency seems to be rather to overstate than understate the age  In pointing out this tendency the Census Commissioner of Gwalior State says that it was brought first to his notice when dealing with the fertility and fecundity schedules  in the returns on w hich it was common to find women who said they had been married four years hut had three children whose ages they gave as 5  3 and I year  Further the abovementioned taboo would not be merely on uttering the name  It would much more often than not  in all probability  be unlucky for an infant to be shown to a strange enumerator  who may therefore have as his only guide the statement of a mother whose ideas of the passage of time are Another attitude is illustrated by the Madras Census of the vaguest possible  Superintendent    “ A Salem  father  challenged about the absence from his account of persons present  of any indication of a very recent arrival  said with some surprise  you count it       ‘  It is but now bom     Do  ’  He continues “ When one reflects on conditions in India it is difficult to place any on the change and I could detect among supervisors a

met by special instructions but illustrates serious  value  wonder that  ‘  ’  it  ‘  ’  well the difficulties of a polyglot census ”  \f81  MISSTATEMENTS OF AGE   69 Apart from ignorance there are many reasons which appear to operate MUttatemenu of Age  towards a deliberate misstatement of age at the census return  This is particuIt is invariably larly the case with unmarried girls who have reached puberty  numbers and this is in defective found that the age period of girls from 10 15 is better caste unwillingness of the no doubt justly put down in part at any rate to already daughters unmarried having Hindus  particularly Brahmans  to admit to pubescent  who should therefore be already married in accordance with the Smritis  It may  injunctions or at least the strong recommendations of the indeed the and secrecy  result of a short enumeration as due to however  be also actual shortconvinced of felt census returns so the 1921 examined actuary who age of enumeration  as distinct from misstatement of age  at the period about 15 years  that it was partly for that reason that he was unwilling to work out any table for the expectation of life  which he considered would be vitiated by short A possible explanation is  in the case of females  to enumeration at that age  be found in the practice in several parts of India of secluding girls at the age of puberty for at any rate certain castes consider it necessary to shut up and conceal pubescent girls independently of any shame at their being unmarried  Thus Dasaris  Dhangars and Killekyatas seclude girls at puberty for 3 to 8 days  and This seclusion of girls when they reach the age of Jains from 9 to 15 days  puberty is probably part of a widely spread custom which may be observed also At the same time it is more than doubtful if there is in Africa and in Oceania  any general shortage of enumeration as suggested by the actuary  and it is clear from the returns that the ages of males are similarly misstated at that period this the actuary  in 1921  attributed to the desire to appear either definitely as a boy or definitely as a man  and it is possible that the practice of early marriage results in some exaggeration of the ages of those just married and a correspondIn the case of males later ing understatement of the ages of those who are not  in life there is apparently a tendency for widowers and bachelors who are becoming elderly to understate their ages  particularly if they are wishful to remarry  On the other hand the Indian age returns do not appear to suffer from any understatement in the ages of adult women  though recently married girls  and particularly those who are mothers  tend to overstate their age  or rather to have their age overstated for them  no doubt since a matron s position gives an impression of age which is not necessarily a true one  particularly in a country in which women are married when exceptionally young  In the case of the old it is a natural tendency on the part of both sexes to exaggerate  and women in particular  being very ignorant of the periods which mark the passage of time  in fact as a magisare inclined to give the most wild statements as to their age trate in court the wiiter has heard a woman of about 35 to 40 years  who gave her age as 100 yeais and caused a titter at the bar  hurriedly restate it as 200 years  The enumerators  it is true  were instructed to correct ridiculous retimns of age  but it  may be doubted whether they weie in all cases competent to do so  The fact that the average life in India is shorter than in the West possibly encourages exaggeration in the eyes of those who do pass their allotted three score years and ten  and this tendency is in some places likely to be encouraged by the practice of performing a ceremony to celebrate the attainment of sixty years of life  Obviously a guess is least inaccurate in the case of the young  wheTe the margin for variation is least  and most inaccurate for the aged  where an error of even twenty years may be difficult to detect     «           Another reason for the misstatement of the coiTect age is a superstitious unwise to state one s age correctly  as this is liable to reduce one’s The Niti Shashtra apparently lays down that a man’s age is one of the nine things which he must carefully conceal   such beliefs are probably dying out  but they probably die extremely hard and they are not peculiar to Another point which affects all ages returned at the census is the practice India  common  if not general  in India of reckoning age from the time of conception and not from that of birth  while yet another element of inaccuracy is to be found in curious methods of reckoning periods of time thus a common method in the Assam hills is to reckon by harvests  A child born in September would have his age stated in November as one year and in the following November as two years old  a form of reckoning which is also applied to events so that an event which took place just over a year previously would be said to have been taken place two years ago on the ground that two harvests had intervened  The error arising from a belief that it is  length of years         M22CC  Q  \f      CHAPTER IV   82      AGE   practice of this kind would be insignificant when  applied to mature years  were it not for the fact that later on the computation is made not by harvests but by the harvesting of a particular plot   a man will remember that within his knowledge such and such plots have been harvested so many times and that the normal cycle of cultivation is  say  seven years  reference is of course not to permanently cultivated this will give a fair approximation to but periodically cultivated flmm lands  There his real age  provided the cycle of cultivation remains at seven years  is no certainty  however  that it may not have been 20 years and been gradually reduced with the result that it very much distorts the return of age given     It is possible that defiberate misstatements of age could be reduced if the persons enumerated could be made to appreciate the fact that their names are eliminated from the returns at the first stage of compilation and that their individual ages are merged into groups  Such confidence  however  is at present wanting  nor was the legislative protection given to the privacy of returns enough to prevent attempts being made to use census schedules as evidence of age in courts of law  and as long as there is that possibihty the necessary confidence is certain to he absent   Ignorance  however  the principal reason for the inaccuracy of the age  is   retiuns  and the Census Superintendent of Central India may here be quoted     “ The Hindus have the custom of casting horoscopes but they are never produced before It is easily recast to suit the enumerator  A horoscope may not often show the true age  one’s needs especially of a matrimonial nature and at times it is re edited when lowering of age is required while seeking Government service The vast majority are both indiSerent and ignorant towards the question  Ignorance is natural in a population which Indifference arises from the outlook on life  is ilhterate and which never keeps any document  The average man or woman in India matures early and is short lived  Life presses heaAoly on them and fatalism overpowers them  Childhood  adolescence  middle life and old age  are well marked stages in life and the Hindu social system has laid down conduct of life and has prescribed rules for the observance of customs and practices  It matters not if the precise age is not known  Apart from any question of reticence  the villager will stare at what he deems an irrelevant enquiry when you ask him to state his age will hesitate will sometimes ask Is it my age   and when pressed will return some absurd answer especially if he is over 45 or 50  So the age recorded in the Census is the one guessed either by the enumerated or the enumerator  If our enumerator is somewhat conscientious he would ask a person when he took to the plough or how old he was when the great famine of 1899 broke out  He may in such cases approach to a nearer approximation  By far the heaviest burden that falls on the enumerator is to guess the age of practically everyone in his block  In the tribal areas  it is a matter of great difficulty to make the tribes return any age at all for many of them are not A local event such as a Raja’s marriage or installation was usually a used to counting  serviceable guide to the enumerator in fixing the age according to his judgment ”       ’  ‘  The Madras Census Superintendent writes of “  The peculiarly practical and realist outlook on life of the average Indian  who yet is often thought to be impractical and visionary  After all  years are a mere convenience for reckoning to exalt them into an absolute standard as is done in western countries  is to give them an undue importance  Capacity is what matters  Thus to the Indian our application    of age limits to govern retirement and general insistence  to show a defective and Preferential Oiglts   on birth certificates seem probably   to use a popular word in India  bureaucratic attitude towards  life ”  70 Again  the age returns of past censuses have made it quite clear that adult Indians have a very marked preference for certain particular digits  This was effectively demonstrated by the Actuary to the Government of India in his Report on the 1921 census  the preference taking the following order 0  5  2  8  4  6 and then the odd numbers 3  7  1  9  With reference to this the Actuary wrote as       follows        “ The method of grouping ages previously adopted  namely  the method by which the numbers living at ages which are multiples of 5 were always treated as the youngest in each group  and with ages stated as age last birthday  produced less accurate results than would be obtained by any other method for which the smallest semblance of justification could be advanced ”   As an illustration of the effect on the age returns of this preference for certain accompanying histogram has been compiled on the actual age returns A glance is enough to in 1931 of 100 000 of each sex from Madras Presidency  show that such retmms cannot possibly represent the real age distribution of the digits the  population   %  \f   FOEMATION OP AGE GROUPS   83  71 In view of this criticism on the Indian Census practice of throwing all ages returned into quinary groups beginning with the digits 0 or 5  it was decided not only to have age returned as age at the nearest birthday instead of as the number of years completed  but to recast the system of obtaining the quinary groups in the way recommended by the Actuary  The method which he recommended  and which has been followed at this census  was to group the ages from 4 upwards into alternate groups of three and seven  Thus the years 4  5 and 6 form the first ternary group which is followed by a septenary group of the years 7 13  In this way the favourite digit 0’ forms the centre of one group  the nevt favourite The actual limits  of age corresponding to these digit 5 ’  the centre of the other  to two groups  assuming that the returns are perfectly correct  would be ternary The alternate years in the second case  to years in the first case and and septenary groups thus obtained were formed into quinary groups by a process of combining their halves  so that the group 10 15 years was obtained by combining half the group 7 13   with half the group 14 16  while the group 15 20 was formed from the remaining half of those aged 14 16 plus half of those aged 17 23  The single year groups below the ages of five years were formed by splitting up group 4 6 into sis parts  two of which went to compose the group 5 10  three of which remained to represent the group 4 5  and one of which went to supplement half the number of those whose age to the nearest bhthday was returned as three years to make the group 3 4  The group 0 1 was composed of those whose age was returned as nil plus half those whose nearest birthday was given as one year  The result has been to give a series of age groups rmdoubtedly very much more accurate in their representation of the actual ages of the general population than could have been obtained by folio sving the old method  It should be made clear  of co urse  that this method of quinary grouping is not a substitute for the return of ages by annual integers  which can be examined and smoothed by any one interested in so The method of sorting followed at this as at previous censuses necessidoing  tates  for purposes of speed and economy  a direct sort into groups instead of a sort    ’  ‘     ‘  by single years and return accordingly  The alternative therefore to a sort into alternate ternary and septenary groups  subsequently to be smoothed into the usual quinary groups  was not a sort into single years but a sort direct into quinary groups beginning with 5 and ending with 0  or vice versa  mth all the inaccuracies involved by the preference for particular digits referred to above  For certain purposes the unsmoothed ternary and septenary groups have been retained as vull appear in the general body of the tables and as will be indicated later in this It will be clear of course that there is this additional difference between report  the two sets of groups  The ternary and septenary groups are in terms of age to the nearest birthday  so that theoretically the groups are divided not at the year of completed age but at the semester before and after  Thus group 7 13 should include all persons who have completed six years and six months and who have not actually completed thirteen years and six months  whereas the quinquennial groups represent a division by years actually completed  so that group 10 15 should include all who have actually reached their 10th birthday and have failed actually to reach their fifteenth  though it be but by hours   The Actuary recommended a further adjustment to rectify the continuous decrement caused by death in the numbers living in the successive age periods of the population  since the method of distributing equal halves of the ternary and septenary groups into quinary groups involved a small error from this course  To rectify this error he recommended a transfer  from each group to the next younger  of the num  er in the older group multiplied by the mean of the rates of mortality applicable to the youngest and oldest ages respectively in the group  These transfers  based on the rates of mortality for All India Males deduced by the Actuary from the 1921 Census returns  involve the following transfeis    0 84 per cent  of group 1 24 35 53 1 55 33 53 2 38 3’ 53 3 66 55 5 09 33 6 87 33  5 7 43 33 3 3  3 3  3 3  M22CC  5 10 to group 10 15 3  20 25 33 30 35 33 40 45 33

Religions for all India and the The otlier subsiresults will be found in Subsidiary Table I to this chapter  diary tables in whicli all India figures of age by religion are involved haA^e also been based on the unadjusted quinary groups  and the same procedure has been followed in the case of the tables in which civil condition is involved  In any case the adjustment to be made for the continuous decrement in successive age periods is so small that for all practical pui’poses it can be ignored  and in point of fact Mr  Vaidyanathan who eieamine  s the 1931 age returns in the annexure to this chapter prefers a different adjustment to that of Mr   Meikle  Periodic Variation   72  Clearly the smoother cpuinquennial age groups of 1931 are not strictly comparable to those of pi eA ious censuses which are uneA enly weighted by preferential digits  This  bias however does not affect the decennial group in which all the series of digits app ear  and the comparison with previous censuses has therefore been made by decennial periods  The table below shows the age distribution of 10 000 males a7id females of the Indian population by Knyearly age groups for the 5

examined and the marginal table gives figures for some communities  Similarly the proportion of persons aged sixty and over to those aged 15 to 40 is an indication of comparative longevity  Comparison

was greatest between 4 and 9 years and at no age attained 40 years  though it came nearest to doing so in Madras  In the Public Health Commissioner’s Report for 1927 the expectation of life in India at the age of five was quoted as 35 years  Returning to the 1901 actuarial report it appears that Burma was better off in this respect as the expectation of life at from 3 to 6 years of age exceeded 42 years for males and at from 3 to 5 years exceeded 43 for females  The infant mortality rate obtained from the same tables is only 23 per cent  in Burma as against almost 30 per cent  in most of

investigation the expectation of life in Intfia is appreciably slightly greater at birth for females than for males but thereafter is life than longer again expect a may females when years  of age the 20 less until better slightly life is expectation of their thereafter age  and same the males of  throughout   The inference is that the female iiifant has greater vitality at birth   but is^ more likely to succumb first on account of the greater tendency in India to neglect girls in favour of boys and secondly on account of the risks of early marriage   The actuarial examination  in 1911 however gave  with less probability perhaps  a better expectation of life for females at all ages up to 80 when the expectations  \f   EXPECTATION OF LIFE   91  were equalised  the male expectation going very slightly ahead at 84 years  At the same time the 1911 examination gave a slightly decreased expectation of life for both sexes and all ages as compared with that of 1901  while the 1901 expectations repeated there were not quite so high as those of 1891  No rates at all were worked out from the census returns of 1921   as the actuary considered that their interest would be purely academic  and that the returns were not reasonably dependable  It would therefore be unwise to attach too much importance to the life tables of preAuous decades  Hie constant figure for the mean age at this census as compared with previous ones and in conjunction with the consistency of the decennial age groups suggests that the expectation of life has not much altered since 1891   though mitil the report of the actuary on the 1931 age returns is available it is not possible to say for certain   Such a report is under preparation at the time of writing and will be found in the armexurs which follows this chapter  As regards Indian mortabty rates generally  it is to be inferred from two articles published  in the Journal of the Instituie of Adnutries in July 1929 that the mortality rate ri«es to maximum at about 55   though in other respects following a similar eourss to that of the United Kingdom  It also appears that of Indians who insure their lives Hindu mojxality is slightly higher than that of other groups  Parsis exj^erieHcing •66 of Hindu mortality  European  To  Anglo Iiidiaji  79 and Muslims  92  though this last figure must be aece rtod ivith reserve  as owing to their ohjeetion to insurance on religious grounds very few Muslima insure their hve« at all  The age distribution of the population in 1931 as compared with 1921 will be found presented for India as a whole and for main communities in Subsidiary Tables I and II at the end of this chapter  A recurrent feature of the Indian age returns is the dip in the curve  v  inf  para  81  at the age group of 15 20  This feature  wliich is much the same in both sexes  is usually ascribed to more or less intentional misstatement of the ages of both sexes in then teens b It is just possible that this dip iu the 1931 curve is the result in part of the depletion  by the influenza epidemic of the end of the last decade  of females of the reproductive ages  It is however pointed out by the Census Superintendent for Central India that there is a general tendency to lower the age of boys for whom matrimonial arrangements are being made allusion to the prevailing misstatement of the age of girls has already been made  wbde in regard to boys the Superintendent of Census Operations for Madras may again be quoted     ‘        “ The Indian outlook on age is  as remarked  much more functional and the advent of so pronounced a vital phenomenon as puberty exercises probably a considerable influence on age If it has arrived the tendency will be to attribute definitely mature years if it has not returns  the tendency may be to diminish the actual tale of years due  Much of this is of course conjectural but the actual age return curves dealt with already do show peculiar aggregations at ages between 10 and 15 and after 20 ”     The difierence in the age  gi oups of  those w ho live in towms may be inferred by  referring to paras  43 and 48 in chapter II above  76  The vital statistics of India  are well known to be defective  They are compiled from records maintained locally by means which vary in difierent provinces  but generally they are kept up by the reports of village officials in rural In the latter case their accuracy wiU naareas and by municipalities in urban  turally depend on the amount of interest taken in the matter by the urban authorThis is not great  and even the rural returns are probably more accurate ities  on the whole  In them however  the reporting of the occurrence of births and deaths is often a troublesome duty which the village headman or chaukidar is apt Obviously in the case of births he is likely to wait and see whether a to neglect  child will live and so save himself in many cases the necessity of making a second report for its death  while he no doubt hesitates to report deaths which would give any excuse for the unwelcome visits of unduly suspicious police officers  Taken on the whole the defect in vital statistics is probably to be estimated at about 20 per cent   though it is much higher at its maximum  For example in Mysore State the deficiency is put at 50 per cent  or even more  The returns from which birth and mortality rates are deduced  and the figures given in the subsidiary tables to this      The expectation of life as deduced by the Actuary from the 1931 returns shows an expectation at birth of 26 66 years for females and 26 91 for males at the ages of 4 and 5 years  respectively  when the expectation is at its Attention is drawn to the superior expectation enjoyed by best  it is 36  75 for females and 38  96 for males  males  The figures are for India as a whole     H22CC  Mtal Statistics  \f                CHAPTER IV   92     ^AGE   chapter and to chapter 1  can therefore be only accepted subject to reservation  They are however probably reliable enough as indications of the general trend of birth and death rates  even though the gross figures themselves are understated in both directions  and in Madras Province the returns are accurate enough to have made it possible for the department of Public Health to prognosticate the result of the 1931 Census with an error  on the excess side  of not more than 2 per cent  Bengal and the United Provinces  in that order  are believed to be the next most accurate in resr^ect of their returns  although the Census Superintendent of the latter province estimates the percentage of error in the record of births as In Assam the Census Superinten15 per cent  and in that of deaths as 22 per cent  dent considers that ‘‘ at least one third of vital

Hungaiy  while it was considerably lower than that of the Straits Settlements  The rate of infant mortality in Indi     during the decade under review shows an appreciable reduction on the rate of the

respiratory diseases coming next  then A special enquiry was made in and then diarrhoea and enteritis  Bombav in 1930 as to the infant mortality rates among working and non working mothers  the results of which are conveniently summarized in Mr  Sorley’s report convulsions   on the  cities of  Bombav     “ The enquiry covered 2 053 cases   Of these 39 2 per cent  were working mothers and 60 8  per cent  non  working mothers  91 48 per cent  were Hindus  3 80 Muslims and 4 72 Indian Christian and 75 per cent  of the workers were textile workers  Tlie average number of live births per working mother in all areas was 2 85 and per non working mother was 2 75  In Naigaum a sanitary area  the figures were 2 91 and 2 78 respectively  As regards still births in proportion to live births the figures were  for all areas  working mothers 34 per cent  and for nonworking mothers 33 per cent  and for Naigaum the figures were 31 per cent  and 27 per cent  It will he obvious that the working class mothers have more children and more re spectively  still births than non working mothers  and that the Naigaum figures are better than the general       \frNFANTHJE AND PUERPEKAL MORTALITY   93  figures  The statistics are curious  The greater prolificness of working class mothers seems to be due to their better economic condition which leads to their having more and better food than the non working mothers  But the unfavourable figures for stiU births amongst working mothers seem to suggest that industrial labour  while not interfering with the conception of children has had effect on child bearing itself  it is by no means unlikely that working mothers work too late before and too soon after child birth and so are liable to certain influences which do not The table below shows the

the three principal causes of infant mortahty are returned as congenital debihty  premature birth and tetanus neonatorum  syphilis being largely The infantile mortahty in Baroda State is said responsible for the second of these  “ child marriage  faulty feeding  contamination of the milk caused by to be chiefly management of children  frequency of motherhood and insanitary ignorant supply  In Calcutta a high rate of infantile mortahty among Mushms is reconditions ”  ported to be a constant feature of the vital statistics and this is to be ascribed in the main to the strict purdah observed even among the poorest Mushms hving in bastis  where ah health visitors report that they meet with most opposition to healthy innoThe above read again with the Bombay figures suggests that immature vations  maternity  purdah and primitive obstetrics are probably still principally responsible for the high rate of mortality among Indian infants and an otherwise somewhat severe critic of the 1911 census report admitted early marriage as a prime cause of the low ratio of females to males and predicted a continued fall of that ratio at the next census and until this cause should be removed  This point of view is supported by what is known of maternity mortality  Obviously the causes of death in child birth are likely to bear an immediate relation to those of death in the first year of life  and an investigation made in Madras into causes of maternal mortality in 7 324 cases in four cities led to the following conclusions  among others     In 6% of confinements the mother was under the age of 15  In 3% of confinements instrumental delivery or other siugical interference was required   The maternal mortality is at its maximum in the earliest ages  being highest in the first confinement  and the earlier the age of the mother the greater the risk of her death   More than 60% of puerperal deaths were due to sepsis or septicaemia  Economic conditions had no bearing on maternal mortahty they seemed almost to have an inverse relationship to neo natal mortality  The incidence of neo natal mortality was greatest in the case of first births  and when the mother was under 20 years of age  Only about one third of confinements received skilled medical aid     In a written statement made to the Age of Consent Committee the Assistant Director of Public Health observed that proportionate to the high maternal and child mortahty “ there is a vast number of invalids or physical wrecks among the survivals ”  and even in Travancore State  more advanced in this respect  perhaps  than any part of India except the adjoining state of Cochin  the Census Commissioner of the State is able to pronounce that     “ The highest female mortality  which exceeds that of males by 60 to 61 per 1 000 occurs in the age period 15 30  and must certainly be attributed to the early marriage of girls and the consequent premature maternity  Death of young mothers at child birth is not an uncommon occurrence  but more common than this  however  is the death of women in the later period of maturity  say  between the years of 20 and 30  brought on by the physical exhaustion  the nervoiis break down and other ailments  which are the aftermath of premature child bearing ”     \f94  CHAPTEB   AGE   INFANTILE MORTALITY PER MILLE OF LIVE BIRTHS IN BRITISH INDIA AND

MADRAS PRESIDENCY  \f\fCHAPTEK IV   96   AGE   The Age of Consent Committee pointed out that the law as to the age of consent was “ practically unknown throughout the country  A knowledge of it was conThe comfined to judges  lawyers and a few educated men ”  Eeport p  18  §  38   mittee also pointed out that early marriage is normally followed by early consummation and in consequence by early maternity  “ Consummation soon after puberty ”  they say  Report pp  97  98 § 226  228  “ is almost universal among classes which Smriti texts are invoked to prove the need of consummation soon after puberty ^preferably within 16 days of the first menses ”  Again  page 67  § 159  “ it is admitted on all hands that the pracIt is also tice of early marriage is widely prevalent throughout Bengal established that      pre puberty consummations are common and that violations One witness states  Evidence  IV  of the Law of Consent occur in many cases ”    cases are not uncommon in which girls bring forth six or seven page 510  that Yet the consequences of early children before they attain their eighteenth year ”  maternity are clear enough  The Age of Consent Committee compares the evd the following terms  page 102 § 232  “ Scttis were few and with that of sau In the case of early maternity the evil is widespread far between After going so extensive as to affect the whole framework of society  through the ordeal  if a woman survives to the age of 30 she is in many cases an old In the case of sati the utter woman  almost a shadow of her former self hideousness of the incident shocked the conscience in this case the famiharity of the evil blinds us to its ghastly results ”  The committee concludes  page 152  “ a large element of truth in the theory that fre§§ 339 and 341  that there is quency of birth has a very direct bearing on maternal and infantile mortality ”    practise early marriage        m           that “ according to the medical evidence the effect of frequency of births at short intervals is far more disastrous when maternity starts at an early age ”  and that whatever methods may be needed or apphed  “ early consummation leading to early maternity ought in any event to be prohibited ”  If anyone doubt the evil effects of early maternity stated in such moderate language by the committee in their report he need only examine the volumes of e^ddence  much of which  in particular the medical evidence  it is quite impossible to read with anything approaching equanimity  And the evils of early maternity are complicated and amplified by the These have been described among conditions under which child birth takes place  others by Dr  H  Suhrawardy  Y D   F R C S I   in his treatise on “ Child Welfare They are well known and it is not proposed to transcribe their description here  but it does seem necessary to refer to the e vidence given before the Age of Consent Committee as indicating that infant mortality is higher among Hindus than among the other communities on account of early marriage and premature births  Evidence  volume I  page 439   and that in a very large number of cases the first born child dies  some witnesses even declaring that they had never known one to survive  ibid  It is worth notice in this connection that an investigation at I  414  II  490   Johnstown   a   U  S  A  showed that still births for mothers under 20 years of age as compared to 4% for mothers aged 20 24  The results of early numbered 1 1 1 maternity with the consequent rapid fall in the numbers of married women after the age of 25 is to be seen in the age curves of both Hindus and Mushms  though possibly in the latter case an important factor in the decrease may be the greater In both these communistrictness of purdah  particularly among the poorer class  ties the curve of female marriage reaches its peak in the group 20 to 25 and then drops sharply to the age group 35 40  after which the steepness is less pronounced  In the case of males the peak is reached 10 years later and the fall between 35 and 40 is much less marked  while in the case of Burmese the marriage curves of both sexes This may be expressed otherwise in follow generally similar and less violent lines  Of the communities in which the greatest number of married percentages thus women are found between the ages of 20 to 25 the total number of females in that age group is found to have fallen in the age group 35 40 in the case of Muslims to 52 4%  and of Hindus to 63 5% as compared with a corresponding fall among and 72 7% respectively  On the other males ftom the same age group to 70 8 hand in the case of Sikhs  while the maximum of married women also occurs in group 20 25  59% of the total number in that group are still found in the group 35 40 as compared to 58 6% of males  If the Burmese be taken the comparison is not quite even  as the maximum number of married women falls five years later  in the 25 30 group  and of the total number of females in that group there are 60 7% to be found in the group 40 45  while the corresponding percentage of males is 63 • 7  •     %              %              •  \fBSTPANTILE  AND PUERPERAL MORTALITY   97  The total numbers in any age group may of course be determined by factors such as disease or migration  but as between different sexes and different communities the comparisons between successive age groups have some validity  In 1927 the maternal mortahty rate for Madras  as disclosed by a special enquiry set on foot by Colonel A  J  H  Russell  was approximately 20 per 1 000 live births  though the figure in the Public Health Commissioner’s Report shows only 5 • 3 and this rate of 20 per millQ may be contrasted with the rate of 2 6 in the Netherlands or 6 5 per mille in the U  S  A  The question of infantile and maternity mortality and of the measures taken to reduce them will be found dealt with in the Annual Reports of the PubUc Health Commissioner with the Government of India for 1927 1928 1929 and in particular for 1930 and it is clear not only that there are a number of voluntary societies at work on the question of infantile mortality such societies as the Seva Sadan Society of Poona or the Indian Red Cross Society in its Health Welfare activities  or the Bombay Presidency Infant Welfare Society  to name three only of many  but that the rate of infantile mortality has been efiectively reduced since the census of 1921 in spite of a greatly increased population  At the sanie time the warning of the Age of Consent Committee as to the inadequacy of such institutions quoted in a later chapter applies also in this connection  Sir John Megaw estimates that “100 out of every 1 000 girl wives are doomed to die in child birth before they have ceased to have babies  and about 200 000 mothers die in giving birth to children every year in India ”  What is really wanted is fewer babies but better ones  and it is possible that efforts should be concentrated less on infant welfare directly than on the reduction of immature maternity  on a general improvement in the standard of living and culture  and on the removal of the causes generally rather than on the treatment of the symptoms                     INFANTILE MORTALITY PER MILLE OF BIRTHS IN 1930 00  £  UNDER ONE MONTH  ONE TO SIX MONTHS   It may be added that nothing in the vital statistics or the infant mortality rates as ascertained by the Public Health Department can be found to support the statement  which seems  if correctly reported by the Daily Herald and the Times of India  to be a grave and quite unjustifiable exaggeration  made at Geneva in 1930 by Mrs  Tarim Sinha that 446 mfants of every 1 000 born in India died from the effects of opium given them by their mothers  If the most ample allowance be made for incomplete returns the gross infantile mortafity rate for India can hardly be computed at much more than half the figure propounded by JMrs  Sinha fof deaths from the effects of opium alone  a cause which does not even figure specifically in the Bombay  Health OfiScer’s list   M22CC  h2  \fi

foUowing extract is taken from the Census Report on the Central Provinces and Berar and relates to an aged wrestler of the name of Siddi Wastad  son of a Negro father and an Arab mother  and now for many years a resident of Nagpur  “ Probably the oldest man in the Province is Siddi Wastad  a retainer of the family of Sirdar Venkatrao In Nagpur he is generally supposed to have passed his 150th year  Gujar of Nagpur City He was one of the famous wrestlers at the court of His Highness the Maharaja Khanderao Gaikwax  father of the present Ruler of Baroda  and must have been almost past his prime as an athlete in about 1850 A  D  He claims to remember the war in Mysore and the death of Tippu Sultan as incidents of his youth  He also saw the last Moghul Emperor and his predecessor  The old man  of course  remembers the Indian Mutiny of 1857 very well and recalls that when he first went to Lahore from Baroda he travelled by road  because there was no railway        He visited Nagpur twice when he was residing at Baroda and was eventually employed as a professional wrestler and instructor in physical tr ainin g for Krishnarao Abasaheb  the father of Sirdar Venkatrao Gujar  This was about the year 1855 and as Siddi Wastad was reputed to have a son of sixty years in Baroda at the time  it would seem probable that the date of his own birth was soon after 1775 A  D  When he came to Nagpur to live with the Gujar family there was no railway line but land had been acquired for constructing a His arrival in the City was just before the destruction of the rail ro^ and earth work was in progress  Mahal by fire  Even allowing for considerable exaggeration  his age would be about 130  Sirdar Venkatrao’s father   was  when Siddi Wastad was first employed as his trainer  about 16 or 17 years of age The old athlete has now been living in Sirdar Venkatrao Gujar’s house for over 75 years and his influence in the family has been very great indeed  It has been the custom in the past for every famous wrestler visiting Nagpur to make a point of pa3dng his respects to Siddi Wastad before giving any exhibition  His own final public contest was with a sepoy in the old rotary cantonment at Amraoti  He defeated this man and became unpopular among the troops as a result        Until the year of the influenza epidemic of 1918 this remarkable man remained in perfect health  He was him self attacked by the scourge and in the ten years following is reported to have had attacks of paralysis and cholera  Since then he has gradually lost his teeth and his hair has turned white  Until 1918 it was not his habit to lie down or to go to bed  A short nap in a chair at night was quite enough for him  and he offered his prayers five times a day  His diet up to that time was about 6 lbs  of flour for one meal  apart from vegetables  rice  mutton and four seers of Hulk each day  His meal used to take him full three hours when his teeth were sound and he now eats  apparently heartily  on his hardened gums  When iU  he has never taken doctor’s drugs but he prepares his own medicines and medicated oils and treats himself   How greatly he is held in awe by the family of his employer and friend is indicated by the fact that he will not allow the room in which he resides to be swept by anybody   Once during his absence Sirdar Venkatrao himself ventured to attempt to clean the room  but he found three large scorpions underneath the prayer rug with the result that he was severely admonished for this venture ’  ‘     \f      ACTUARIAL REPORT   107  REPORT ON THE ESTIMATED AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INDIAN POPULATION AS RECORDED AT THE CENSUS OF 1931 AND THE RATES OF MORTALITY DEDUCED FROM A COMPARISON OF THE CENSUS RETURNS FOR 1921 AND 1931  I had the honour to be invited by the Government of India to make an investigation into the estimated age distribution of the Indian population as indicated by the Census figures of 1931 and to prepare Life Tables as deduced by a comparison of the Census records of 1931 with one or more of the preceding Census enumerations and now beg to submit the results of my investigation     This is the sixth of a series of investigations into the Mortality of the Indian population conducted in connection with each decennial Census from 1881 onwards  The first three were made by the late Sir George Hardy  the fourth by the late Mr  T  G  Ackland and the fifth in connection with the 1921 Census by Mr  H  G  W  Meikle  the then Actuary to the Government of India   PROVINCES DEALT WITH IN THIS REPORT  The larger Feudatory Indian States that conduct separately their own Census operations were not included in any of the previous investigations  The areas dealt with in these investigations were mainly British Provinces and the smaller Feudatory States under the direct political control of the Provincial administration  I decided  however  to conduct the present investigation on the Census Statistics available for the whole Indian Empire including all the Feudatory States whether small or large  The Indian Subcontinent  covering an area of more than 1 800 000 square miles and containing a population of almost 353 millions  was divided for the purpose of my enquiry into the following ten large geographical units    1  Sind   Baluchistan and North West Frontier Province    2   Punjab  Delhi and Kashmir    3   Rajputana  Ajmer Merwara  Gwalior and Central India Agency    4   The United Provinces    5   Central Provinces  Berar and Hyderabad State    6   Bihar and Orissa    7   Bengal and Assam    8   Bombay Presidency  excluding Sind   Baroda State and the Western India States    9  The Madras Presidency  Coorg   Mysore   Travancore  and Cochin  States   10   Burma  Burmans only excluding foreign born    Each British Province includes the small State or relationship with  political  States   if  any  in  direct  it   Though Sind is politically a part of Bombay  in view of its great distance from Bombay and the greater affinity of the population of Sind to its immediate neighbours  it was decided to amalgamate it with Baluchistan and North West Frontier Province   The data supphed to me for the purpose of my investigation included      1  The Census Returns of 1931 showing in each Province and for each sex the numbers living at the ages of 0  1  2  3 and in alternate ternary and septenary groups 4 6  7 13  14 16  17 23  etc   with one large group at the end of 74 and  over   2   Specimen Schedules  in connection with the 1921 Census  showing out  of a selected number  usually about 100 000 of each sex in each Province  the numbers recorded as living at each individual age last birth day throughout life   3   Birth place Returns showing   a   M22CC  the number of emigrants born in each Province or State and enumerated elsewhere  and  \fANNEXURE TO CHAPTER IV   108  6      ^AGE   the number of immigrants enumerated in each Province or State and born elsewhere    4   The Provincial and All India Census Reports on the 1921 Census    5   The Actuarial Reports based on the 1921 and the preceding Censuses   No returns at individual ages  except those at the very early ages from 0 to 3  and no specimen schedules showing the distribution of the population at each age  except in the case of the Punjab and Madras out of a sample of 100 000 in each with the 1931 Census  This has proved to me a very great handicap  and I could not apply to the 1931 Census certain hnes of investigation I made with the aid of the specimen schedules available in the Actuarial Reports of the earlier Censuses  especially in connection with the enquiry whether the very large errors in the Age Returns in India show a tendency to diminish or increase  Nor are their uses confined to the study of errors in age as there are bound to be other lines of Statistical Research in which individual Age Returns of the population will be of great help  By the time the Government of India requisitioned my services in connection with the Actuarial Analysis of the 1931 Census  1 learnt to my disappointment that only ternary and septenary groups above referred to were available  I do not think it should entail any great expense if Tables are given for each Province showing the distribution of the population according to individual ages in each sex  The population statistics of England and Wales are available for each age  If  however  for one reason or other  this is considered impracticable for the next few decades in the Census history of India I cannot too strongly recommend that specimens showing distribution of the population at each age should be collected in each Province and in each State that conducts its own Census operations  The characteristics of the specimen are summarised in statistical language in the words “ Representative Random Sample ”  A sample of 100 000 may be a representative one for a small area but may not be so for a large one  The magnitude of the sample should  therefore  depend on the area dealt with  Where again a large area is concerned  the sample should be taken from two or more localities widely separated from one another otherwise the sample will neither represent the entire area nor be a random one  sex  were available in connection     SECTION 1  Characteristics of the Decennium 1921 1931  1   The method to be adopted in the Actuarial Analysis of the Census material influenced by the economic and hygienic conditions pre   of India is very largely vailing in the  decade preceding the Census   A population of which 90 per cent   or more is rural  subsisting mainly on the produce of the soil and cattle  leading a practically insular life in the village of its occupation  with its needs necessarily  brought down to the barest minimum  should be extremely sensitive to the caprice If the rainfall is seasonal and sufficient a good harvest is reaped and the of nature  population  remunerated in most cases in kind  moves in harmony with the season  With bountiful harvest  a feeling of optimism permeates the entire atmosphere and conditions are conducive to health and abundant supply of babies  On the other hand  a lean harvest  engendered by the failure of the monsoon  leads to undernourishment and to contamination of any available scanty water supply which makes epidemics of the nature of Cholera  particularly connected with the bowels  break out  The death rate soars very high claiming a very large toll from the very young and the very old and underfeeding due to scarcity usually gives the people  under such circumstances  very little stamina to withstand the attack  The fall in the birth rate  combined with the very high mortality affecting childhood  leaves a deep chasm in the age curve noticeable in the Age Returns of several subsequent decennial Censuses just as a permanent scar from a deep wound  2  If the next few years after a famine happen to be good or even normal monsoon years  the surviving population consisting mainly of those that have weathered the storm is known to have more than made up for the children lost   It is usual to have 100 000 individuals of each sex sorted by individual ages for each province  This was not done in 1931 as the Actuary to the Government of India advised that it would not be necessary if Mr  Meikla’s method of grouping were adopted  J  H  H      \f   109  ACTUARIAL REPORT   By the side of the deep chasm in the age curve above referred to  there would usually appear a big hump and as it very rarely happens during the famine years   that any Province in India is uninterruptedly immune from these seasonal disturbances for a decennial period  the age curve is generally full of undulations at successive short ranges which are either accentuated or masked by the preference 3  digits and the systematic errors in the ages returned by the populafor particular tion  To bring out the true or nearly true age curve from such irregular data  the Actuarial microscope has to be used rather very minutely and the method adopted is made to suit the nature of the statistics presented to the Actuary which in its turn is primarily influenced by the conditions obtaining in the decennium  under consideration  In illustration of the point made out in the last two paragraphs  the following Table showing the number of children under 5 per j0 000 of the total population Corresin India in each of the Census enumerations may be found of interest  and the United in Europe ponding figures for some representative

1881 enumeration is to be traced to the famine of 1876 78 which affected the Provinces of Madras and Bombay  It will be noticed that  in spite of the large reduction of the young shown in the returns of two very large Provinces  the total for India was appreciably in excess of several European counrries and was only slightly in defect of the number for the United States of America  The 1891 Census followed a period of general prosperity which is evidenced in the very large proportion of children in the age distribution of the population  The widespread nature of the famine of 1899 1901 is reflected in the very small number of childi en under 5 retuimed at the 1901 Census which low record has been beaten only by the 1921 enumeration  The conditions obtaining in the decennium preceding the 1911 Census  though generally free from scarcity and consequent famine  were less favourable than those of the period 1881 1891 as reflected in the number of children under 5 which  though appreciably in excess of the other countries brought in the comparison  is very much in defect of the high level reached in 1891  5  The particularly low figure for 1921  lower than any previous famine record  bears eloquent testimony to the fact  that the young ages were subject to a twofold depletion due to the selective incidence of the Influenza mortality of 1918The first wave was particularly fatal to children  while the second and 1919  the more viiulent one  by claiming a very large toll from the adult ages and proving particularly fatal to women in pregnancy  had struck a heavy blow at the very source of child supply  6  As against the large fluctuations in the number of children in India with the normahty or otherwise of the conditions obtaining during the decade preceding the Census can be set the steady trend towards fall of the number of children in the Western countries due purely to sociological reasons  7  Where the decade preceding the Census was subject to dire visitations such as famine and pestilence  the method adopted by the renowned Actuaries  who wrote the Reports in connection with the earher Censuses  was to estimate average rates  \fANNEXUBE TO CHAPTER IV   110   AGE   of mortality by combining  tbe data of fcbe Census on band with those of a few Censuses thereby eliminating  as far as this could be done  the effects of the disturbances above referred to  earlier  8  Thus with respect to his 1881 Report  the late Sir George Hardy obtained average rates of mortality  firstly because the earlier Census enumeration was known to be extremely defective and secondly because of the famine of 18761878 which affected the two Provinces of Bombay and Madras  Since  however  the decennium ending with the 1891 Census was practically free from famine or epidemic that usually follows in the trail of a famine  he limited his investigation to a comparison of the 1881 and 1891 Census figures  The 1901 Census closely followed on the heels of the severe famine of 1899 1901  vhich affected extensive tracts in India  and also an epidemic of Plague  Sir George  therefore  deduced average rates of mortality by combining the Census figures of 1881  1891 and 1901 by giving double weight to the 1891 Retura  The decennium preceding the 1911 Census was  in spite of distinbances of moderate intensity in certain localities  taking the country as a whole  generally free from any calamitous visitation  and the late Mr  T  G  Ackland deduced rates of mortality relating to the decennium by combining the 1891 and the 1901 Census figures only  The conditions attending the 1921 Census were  however  exceptional  The population had not by then fully emerged from the devastating effects caused by the great Influenza epidemic which was estimated to have   laimed as its victim nearly 7 per cent  of the total population of India  Mr  H  G   V  Meikle  the Actuary to the Government of India  who wrote the Report with the 1921 Census  with the view to deduce average rates of mortality  combined all the previous enumerations from 1881 onwards with the 1921 figures   9  Though the decennium under consideration opened and closed in gloom  has been on the whole a prosperous one  In the opening years of the decennium the efiects of the Influenza epidemic that prevailed at the close of the last decade and the bad monsoon of 1920 were still evident  This position rapidly altered and a series of good monsoons followed interrtipted only by floods notably in Bengal  Gujarat  Sind and South India  Famines were practically local and not very serious and the advancement in Medical Research minimised to a great extent deaths from Tropical diseases such as Cholera  Plague and KalaThese favourable conditions are naturally reflected in the very large increase azar  per cent   in the population which the decennium lias witnessed  The closing  10 6 years of the decennium  however  brought the position practically back to that of the opening one s  with this difference that towards the close there was considerably larger number of mouths to feed than at the commencement on practiTrade was depressed to an unprecedented cally identical economic conditions  level and the prices of agricultural products fell so low as to be entirely unremunerative to the cultivator  The consequent distress to a population of which nearly four fifths live directly by agriculture could be easily imagined  ^Vhether the prosperity of the few middle years of the decennium has been of such magnitude a s to ju stify the very large iticreasc of 10 6 per cent  of the population or in absolute figure s 33 89 5 298  an increase which  in the words of Dr  Hutton  the Census Commissioner for India  is “ a figure approaching equality with that of the total population of France or Italy and appreciably greater than that of such important European Powers as Poland and Spain ” is a subject on which I  shall have something to say in another section of this Report  Here 1 am mainly concerned with the fact that in fhe decade under consideration the population did contribute a very large almost abnormally large increase  apparently both by saving in deaths and by abundant supply of babies and on this account 1 felt justified in making use of the 1921 and 1931 Census figures only thereby confining my attention solely to the conditions obtaining in the decennium  it        SECTION II   On the peculiar nature of the Methods to be adopted in constructing Mortality Tables from Indian Census Returns  1   In the preceding section of this Report attention was directed to the charac   teristics of the decennium under consideration being the main factor influencing the  decision of the Actuary as to whether the mortahty Table to be constructed should be an average one embodying the experience of more than one decennium or  \f       ACTUARIAL REPORT   Ill  should be confined only to that of the deceniiium preceding the Census  In this section T shall consider the peculiar novelty and difficulty of the problem of mortality Table construction ap jlied to this country caused by the fact that the records of vital occurrences are entirely undependable   which makes it necessary to discard tlie usual metluids of con struction of mortality Tables and adopt special ones as I explain beltAv

irregularities As between tbe records cd births are traceable to records of Vital Statistics  and deaths  larger inaccmacies are natimally traceable to tbe former than to tbe study of the figures in the Table will show that Delhi  Assam and Bengal latter  are almost in tbe vanguard of Provinces that maintain inaccurate vital records as the increases in tbe pojmlation of tbe decade in these Provinces traced through vital records are nearly 64  61 and 57 per cent  re  ^pectively in defect of the increases revealed by the Census enumeration  Burma and tbe North West Frontier Pro’ uuce closely follow with the respective deficiencies of 51 and 45 per Bombay shows a deficiency of 35 per cent  The United Provinces sbo w cent  a large excess of 29 per cent  As this is an emigrating Province  tbe only exjfianation is that in this Province the records of deaths are more inaccurate than the   M22CC I  A  \f112  AIWEXtlRE TO CHAPTER IV     AGE   records of births  Madi as alone  of all the Provinces  is remarkably accurate as the the deficiency is only one half per cent  It outpaces the second best Province Central Provinces and Berar by a considerable distance as the deficiency in this Province is as much as 1 1 per cent  It might be possible to approach the censused population with very great accuracy through records of vital occurrences  even if the latter be inaccurately maintained and therefore subject to very large errors  provided such errors are of the same or nearly the same absolute magnitude  For  in arriving at the population on any date with the aid of the records of births and deaths  the numbers relating to births and deaths occcur with opposite signs and therefore the errors in these two records are of a compensatory nature  One is therefore forced either to assume that the records of vital occurrences in Madras are maintained up to a great degree of accuracy  or that both the records of births and dcath  s are teeming with ina ccuracie s and these inaccuracies happen by chance to be very nearly equal   so as to reproduce the censused population within an error of one half per cent  As observed above  the records of births in all Provinces except the United Provinces are relatively more inaccurate than the records of deaths  With the Pro dnce of Madras  however  as between assuming that both the records of births and deaths are inaccurate or both of them are very accurate  I am inclined to the latter view which is also borne out by the relatively greater accuracy shown liy that Province in the statement of ages as will be seen Errors in Age in the section on It may  therefore  be of interest to construct mortality Tables for the Province of iVIadras according to the usual method of mortality Table construction when the records of births and deaths are dependable and compare the results so obtained with those deduced by making use of Census enumerations only  As  however  I have not been supplied with the full statement of deaths in Madras occurring in the decennium according to each age  this investigation could not be taken up before the time my Report was expected to be ready         4  With the records of vital occurrences teeming with inaccuracies in each Province  as shown by the above Table  the Actuary has no course open but to make as best an estimate as he could of the rates of mortality prevailing amongst the population liy making use of the Census enumerations only  without any reference to the reccuds of births and deaths  5  For tlie convenience of the reader who will not take anything on trust  have tried to set out in the next few articles the rationale of the method to be adopted when mortality Tables are constructed by making use of Census Returns only  As a hint  however  to such of the readers as would let anything in the nature of ^Mathematics alone  I have placed an asterisk to these articles which can safely be passed over  But they are requested to assume that for the construction of the mortality Table the Actuary requires a series of smooth numbers representing the mean population living from age to age in the period under consideration and also another set of smooth numbers denoting the rate at which the population has increased or decreased at each age in the same  I  period   Construction of Mentality Tables from Census Returns only   6  In countries where a reasonable degree of reliance can be placed on vital occurrences the only coiTect method of constructing a mortality Table is to make use of Census Returns along with the records of deaths  At the infantile ages  however  where the Census figures are subject to irregularities of a two fold nature due to both overstatement of age and non enumeration of infants  use has to be made of the records of births also in the quinquennium preceding the date of the Census to correct the Census figures relating to these early ages  If we are dealing with an ideal population where only as many die in a year as are born in the year  where there are no migration disturbances  called by Actuaries a Stationary Population  and where the adult population has come to such a high level of literacy as to give correct particulars at a Census  we shall arrive at the same results when constructing a mortality Table from Censuses alone as when we make use of both Census Returns and records of vital occurrences  If P ‘f persons are lecorded as having attained age x on their birthday preceding the Census date  their average age taking one with another can be assumed to be If at the Census taken 10 years later there are returned persons of  P^^  \f      ACTUARIAL REPORT   113  age x 10 last birthday  the latter will be the survivors from amongst the group persons of age x last birthday recorded at the preceding Census and will of Provided that the chief desiderata of a stationary be of average age population as to the constancy of birth and death rates as also immunity from migration disturbances are actually realized  the ratio P^^ io P i’ may be taken as very nearly equivalent to ioP  i which is the probability of surviving 10 years at exact age x i  It will  however  be necessary to find the probability of surviving one year  instead of 10 years for the construction of the mortality Table  which can be obtained as follows  1  Under the ideal conditions of a stationary population which we have assumed  it can be easily seen that the numbers returned at the latter Census at any age x will be identical with the numbers returned at the Census 10 years This equality will hold whatever may be the interval earlier  at the same age  between the two Censuses  If two Censuses are taken with an interval of only P%i P‘^  where one year separating them we shall obtain the equationf is the probability of surviving one year at age x     and P f i represents the population returned as of age 2c   l last birthday at the latter of the two Censuses  Since the numbers returned at the same age in any two Censuses identical we have P‘  i Pi i PiVi P‘i so that iPi j P‘  i P‘P  It will are be evident from an inspection of the above equations that given a stationary population the numbers returned at each age at one Census enumeration would easily supply the numerical values of the probabilities required for the construcBut no community conforms to the rigorous condition of the mortality Table  being called a stationary one and we shall have to modify our tions imposed for numerical values of the probabilities of surviving at each age formula yielding requirements are relaxed one by one and we pass on from an when the ideal actually community one met with subject to varying to imaginary stationary combined disturbances due with to emigration and immigrarates birth and death tion   Varying Birth Rate with Constant Death Rate and no Migration Disturbance   8  Let us assume that the number of births has been increasing uniformly from year to year for a considerable number of years in geometrical progression while the death rate has been constant at each age and there has been no migra   On our assumptions  the number of births per annum increased from  say  that period of one year just preceding the first Census date to r ^ Z^ in that period of one year just preceding the next decennial Census date  Let us denote the number of children of age less than 1  age 0 last birthday  returned at the These are the survivors out earlier of the two Censuses we are considering by L^  The population returned at of the Zg

by     L®  and  respectively   It  can easily be  That this result should be true  verified that  whatever may be the mean population we are taking could have been foreseen inasmuchas it is true for the populations enumerated at each of the two Censuses we are considering  I could not take it for granted since it may not be evident to one and all of the readers  I have  however  assumed in the case under consideration the death rate to be the same as in the case first considered but only the birth rate to vary  The probability  therefore  of surviving one year at age x    J is even now   ^  identical with its  value when all the conditions of a stationary population are satisfied  The natural conclusion to be drawn is that  whereas when a population has attained an absolutely stationary condition the number at any age of one Census enumeration  or  what is the same thing  of the intercensal  mean  population between two Censuses  divided by the number at the age next below yields the probability of surviving one year at the half age midway between the two ages  when one of the conditions  namely  constancy of births from year to year  is relaxed  the ratio above described no longer gives the required probability of survivorship  but we shall have to take into account the rate of increase of the population and multiply by this rate the ratio of the mean numbers at consecutive ages to obtain the probabilities of survivorship at each half age from which the mortality Table can be easily constructed   10  Since the population at age x of one  Census becomes by survival that  at age x flO at the next decennial Census and both of them are the survivors to ages X and x  f  10 in the two Censuses respectively out of births occurring in the  same year  we can  by dividing the number returned at any age x  f 10 at a Census by the number returned at age x at the preceding decennial Census  obtain the      the probability of surviving 10 years at age   value of and thereby eliminate any necessity for bringing into account the rate of increase in the those of population  From the values of can be obtained by a Before  however  this method could be suitable method of interpolation  adopted  one has to be absolutely certain that the only cause contributing towards a return of varying numbers at the same age from one Census to another is variation in birth rate  of which the magnitude is exactly ascertainable  and the rate of mortality has been practically invariable and the population has Such conditions are also been immune from disturbances due to migration  ideal and are not true to populations that are usually met with  It might be observed in passing that with only varying birth rate  if Census taking be an annual function  we shall obtain the value of at each central age by taking represents the population at the earlier Census where the ratio at the Census taken one year later  and thereby avoid the necessity and for ascertaining the rate at which the population has been varying due to variation in birth rate   With the view to make it easy for the general reader I have assumed the variation in the population to be brought about by the number of births increasing in a geometrical progression of constant common ratio r  The arguments will  11   still hold if the variation be not at the uniform rate from year to year but at

Constant Birth Rate and no Migration Disturbance   12  I have so far considered the construction of a mortahty Table from Census Returns alone firstly when the population satisfied all the conditions necessary for its being called a stationary one and secondly when only one of the conditions  viz   constancy of the number of births from year to year  was relaxed  We can now assume the births to remain constant from year to year while the  \fACTUARIAL REPORT   115  When the birth rate alone varies  either uniformly at a constant rate r or at rates changing from year to year  the force or forces that bring about variation in the population returned at the same age in the several Census enumerations all act at one particular point of age  namely  at birth  When  however  variation in population is a result of continuously varying death rate varies   death rate only  the other conditions of a stationary population holding  these forces act at all age points and the variation at any age between two Census enumerations represents the cumulative effect of these forces from birth up to the age in question  In spite of this apparent complication  since on our assumption the variation in the Census material is introduced by an irregular flow only in rates of death from year to year and from age to age and the assignment of a numerical value of this factor  rate of death  being the object of our by the ratio enquiry  we shall yet be able to obtain the average value of evidently the population numbering P^ io at the later Census S S 10 are the survivors out of P^ ’ at age x at

within 10 years at age x     J prevailing in the intercensal period and the probabihties of death or survival for one year at each half age will have to be obtained by interpolation though the resulting values might be very rough and require graduation due to the irregular incidence of mortality  The results of two annual Censuses will have to be made use of if interpolation is to be avoided as in the case when only the birth rate varied          13  If P“ be the mean population at age x between two decennial Censuses  whether it is the Arithmetic  Geometric or Harmonic mean or mean computed in as it any other manner  the ratio P“ i P“ does not   ield the value of does when the population has been absolutely stationary  The cause is not far to seek if it is remembered that on our assumption P^ i and P^ which represent survivors to the middle date of the intercensal period out of births in difierent  though consecutive  years have been depleted differently by varying incidences of mortality from birth up to age x in each case and the ratio P“ i P” instead of depending upon the mortality rate from age x  f ^ to x  fj l is coloured by the varying incidences of mortality above referred to at all ages below age x  To make the ratio P  i P“ yield the value iPx  j we must multiply it by a quantity r  which represents the ratio of the cumulative effect of mortality from birth to age x for the mean population P“ to the corresponding effect The problem in this case is analogous of mortality for the mean population P ^i  to that when only the number of births varied  for  it will be remembered in  that case to obtain the value of iPz i it was necessary to multiply the ratio ^ where r is the ratio of the number of births in that year of Pf i P“ which P“ are the survivors to the births in the year of which P^ j are the survivors  it is not possible to ascertain and make allowance incidences of mortality in the two quantities Pf and P“ i above referred to  due to the death registers not having been accurately maintained  the only method to be adopted is to ascertain for each age an average rate of increase or decrease in the population for the intercensal period and starting from the mean population between the two Censuses as base obtain the population that would have been returned six months anterior and six months posterior to the middle date of the intercensal period from which the values of can be easily   14  ^^^lere  however   for  the varying  deduced   Varying Birth and Death Rates   15  It can now be seen that when both the birth and death rates vary the equation Pi  o P‘i wPx i will yet hold  For P “ o and P    being persons        10 and x in the latter and earlier Censuses respectively are the at ages x survivors out of the births occurring in the same year and in taking the ratio of the one to the other the disturbing effect in the constant flow of population from birth to age x  f   due to variation in the birth rate  the r of the  geometric increase or decrease  is eliminated  Again the same fact  namely  that the populations P ^  o and P^^   relate to births in the same year  is responsible for eliminating in the ratio Pj lo P i^ the rates of mortality from birth to age x f   and making it depend solely on the rates of mortality for the 1122CC  \fANNEXTJRE TO CHAPTEB IV   116   AOE   period of 10 years after age x  r   From the values of wPx i those of iPx i and then of ijOj  can be obtained by interpolation   16  The question might naturally be asked at this stage as to why this apparently easy method of arriving at the values of wPx i at each half age should not be adopted  The answer is not far to seek if it is remembered that all along we have assumed that the inditdduals composing the community have come to realize the importance of giving correct particulars both as to numbers and But the necessity for employages at the Census enumeration and do give them  ing the rather out of the way method of constructing the mortality Table by comparing two or more Census enumerations only  without any reference to the record of vital occurrence s in the intercensal period  arose out of the fact that the latter were quite unreliable  It will  therefore  be entirely unjustifiable to assume that the ages returned at the Censuses are correct when the birth and death records What usually happens with every step taken forward are entirely undependable  in the scale of literary evolution of a community is that the accuracy of the ages recorded in the death registers   reccde that of Census Returns  Apart from the fact that Law  under pain of penalties  compels the registration of births and deaths  the usual inducement for overstatement or understatement at particular periods of life which exist with respect to living persons at a Census enumeration That is why it is often is very nearly absent when giving the ages of the dead  mortality Table is to compare said that the only correct method of constructing a register of births at infantile the living with the dead with further help from the ages    17  It will hardly  need any demonstration to show that  when the Census  material is subject to variations  due to the combined effect of irregular birth and death rates  the ratio Px i R  obtained from the mean of the two Census enumerations will not yield the value of  Px i  It will be remembered that the ratio did not yield the value of this quantity even when only one of the two disturbTo make the above ratio yield the value of  iPx ^

allow for if statistics of the immigrant  and emigrant population have been maintained according to age   19  If I^ and E   be the number of immigrants and emigrants respectively at age x during the

Provinces is not very material  Further  Migration Statistics are not available according to age  The Actuary has  therefore  to make as good an estimate as The deaths amongst possible of the age distribution of the migrant population  the net imnfigrant population though comparatively of small significance will have to be allowed for by him in each age group by using his best judgment    21  I think a few word s at summarising the results arrived at so far will   in view of the help it may give at clarifying the point under consideration  not be considered redundant  For the sake of simplicity I shall assume either that  disturbances due to migration do not exist at all or if they do  appropriate corrections have been made to the censused population to eliminate as far as possible If correct ages are returned at the Census we shall obtain errors due to them   the following results     I  On the supposition that the population has been absolutely stationary for a long

variation due to irregular incidence of rates of death from birth to age X and is obtained by an analysis of the records of deaths  In all the four cases PL  o Pi’ loPx i from which the values of iJOx i can be obtained by interpolation   P      22  These methods are available if  and only if  both the desiderata given below hold  1   2   that the ages returned at the Census are absolutely correct  and that accurate records of births and deaths  the latter correct ages  have been maintained in the past   according to   23  Since the ages returned at the Indian Censuses  including the latest one  have been manifestly full of errors both of a major and minor nature  added to which is the proverbial inaccuracy of the records of Vital Statistics maintained by the Provinces  we shall have to adopt special methods and construct mortality Tables by using Census enumerations alone  The fact that the Census enumerations are full of errors rules out the method of decennial interpolation from the     equality P^ io  Px’ f^ct that the records of Vital Statistics are not maintained accurately makes it impossible to find out the factors r and  mentioned above  representing correcting factors for the irregular incidences of births and deaths   24  The question will natmally be asked as to what is the method to be adopted which will minimise the effect of the errors in the Census material and provide mortahty rates on which reasonable reliance can be placed  The answer equation naturally suggested by the is when Census Px io Px’ operations are undertaken once in 10 years or by the equation P^x^ i P P  when Censuses are taken annually  Taking the former of the two equalities it will be seen that if the numbers at each age returned at the two Censuses could be successfully graduated so as to remove errors we shall obtain the value The disadvantage of this method is due to the fact of loPx i at each age  that methods of graduation are not entirely successful in removing major deliberate Since the values of loPx i are to be obtained from two sets of numbers errors  having residual errors in themP ^°^ and P ^  independently graduated and selves  the errors in the computed values of ioJ x i will be accentuated or     masked according as the residual errors in P ^°^ and P^^^ are in opposite or in the same direction with the natural result that small errors in the graduated values and P^^^ may be magnified in the computed values of of P^ With such errors magnified in them these values will not give as accurate a measure as desirable of the manner in which the number P x^^ at the first    1C32CC  •  \fANNEXUBE TO CHAPTER IV   118  Census diminished to P^ io at  the   AGE   next decennial Census  due  to  the  opera   tion of mortality   25  The only other method that would to a large extent minimise this error suggested by the equality     r^  Vf ijYf According to this method we graduate the mean population of the intercensal period and by comparing the two Census enumerations in suitable age groups obtain and graduate the rates of natural increase of the population which will provide smooth values of 7  the rate of natural increase or decrease of the population at each age x in the decennium due to the combined operation of varying incidences in the birth and death rates  By multiplying the graduated mean population at each age x by     is     respectively we obtain the respective number of people that would have and been returned at each age had two Censuses been taken  one on a date six months anterior and the other six months posterior to the middle day of the decennial period  By this device  from the figures of two Censuses taken with an interval of 10 years between them  we obtain the figures of two Censuses with only one year at each half age are then obtained from the separating them  The values of  equality  P  i »‘72o P^     This is  the  method that has been adopt   ed in the construction of the mortality Tables for all the Provinces  26  No apology  I hope  is needed for this lengthy description of the pecuUar methods to be adopted in constructing mortality Tables from Indian Census Returns without which  I am sure  those for whose benefit Census publications are usually meant will find it difficult to appreciate why for instance the mean population should be calculated or  as a matter for that  what has the rate of increase in the population to do with the rate of death  The average man of letters is afraid of anything in the nature of statistics on the ground that “ it is all dull stuff ”  It might take several years before the average reader realizes that statistics are nothing but numerical expression of facts a knowledge of which is essential to enable one to be prepared for difficulties which might occcur  They are more inclined to swear at statistics whereas they should swear by them  It will therein the language of my esteemed friend  Mr  S  V  Mukherjea  Census Commissioner for Baroda  “ to humanise the document Talking of the general apathy of the public towards Census publications  Mr  Mukherjea in his “ My experience has been that a Census Report  characterisfic style vTites although intended for the general benefit of students and officers  is rarely read  Officers and publicists like to get a complimentary copy for it is the thing to do so look at its opening pages and

humble pages  their author will be the last person to know  of the doctors  27  If this is the language in which  of the public to a Census Report  lengthy description given above  Mr  Mukherjea deplores the lack of interest  my lot has been cast with a drier subject and the is an humble attempt to “ humanise my docu   ment ”   SECTION III  Errors in age   The huge magnitude and the very nude range  of the errors in the a^es returned at the Indian Censuses constitute another important contributing factor towards making the task of the investigating Actuary particularly difficult  So much has been said in the past by successive Census Commissioners and Census Superintendents of each Province and State of the errors that abound in the ages returned at the Indian Census that any lengthy description by me of the psychological factors that lie at the root of these errors would be to emphasise the obvious  A large part of the Actuarial Report in connection with the 1921 Census is devoted to a consideration of the question of errors in age  1   Before I consider the actual nature and extent of the errors in age one more or less peculiar to Indian Census has to be mentioned  namely  that people have no clear notions as to the distinction between age last birthday and age next birthday and always mix up the two  This was proved beyond doubt by my predecessor by reference to the 1891 and the 1 901 Censuses of the Punjab  Curiously enough  in the former of the two Censuses  2   special characteristic of ^^tal importance  \fACTUARIAL REPORT   119  the people of that Province were asked to state their age next birthday whereas in other Provinces the age asked for was the age last birthday  In the subsequent Census  however  the asked age for in the Punjab well as in as the rest of India 3  was age last birthday  In the former of the two Censuses  to bring the Punjab figures in conformity with the figures for the rest of India  conversion was effected from age next birthday to age last birthday by scheduling the number returned at each age opposite the next youngei age             A part   of the full Table appearing on” page 7 of Mr  Meikle’s Report on the  “ Age Distribution and Rates of MortaUty  relating to the two Censuses of the  Punjab is given below   TABLE HI  ’Numbers recorded at each aqe in 1891 and 1901 out of 100 000 persons in the Punjab  1891  1901     A  Age            ^     Males   Females   Males   Females   27  28  1 491  1 500  801  656  28  29  348  400  1 665  1 661  29  30  5 511  6 180  373  374  30  31  219  148  5 257  6

next birthday and is  therefore  scheduled opposite to age 29 last birthday  This number 29 is really a very unpopular one as is evident from the small number 373 returned at that age last birthday at the 1901 Census  Successive Censuses have revealed that numbers  relatively large as compared to the adjoining ages  have been returned at ages 4  ending with 2 and 8   This is evident from the comparatively large numbers entered opposite a^e periods 27 28 and 31 32 in the 1891 Census as these were returned for ages 28 and 32 next birthday respectively  In the subsequent Census  however  numbers more or less equally large were returned for ages 28 and 32 last birthday respectively  A study of the full Table to which reference has been made will show that this characteristic is repeated roimd about all ages end in 0 or 5  It is  therefore  evident that people fixed their attention only which 5  on the number indicating the age to be returned and were not influenced in the least by the age asked for being either the age last birthday or next birthday  Mr  Meikle states that it may  therefore  be assumed that the ages returned are the nearest birthday  What  however  appears to me to be the reasonable conclusion to draw is that the numbers returned at each age would have been the same whether ages next birthday or last birthday or nearest birthday had been asked for  A confusion similar to the one between age last birthday and age next birthday in India affected also the returns as to duration of marriage asked for in the 1911 Census of the United Kingdom as was pointed out by Sir Alfred Watson in the discussion on a Paper submitted by Dr  Stevenson on the “ Fertility of the various Social Classes ” to the Royal Statistical Society in April 1920   The change made in the 1931 Census of recording age nearest birthday instead of last birthday appeals to be one in the right direction on the primary ground that the greater care and thought necessary in giving an age to the nearest birthday taking into account the number of completed months after the last integral age  are more conducive to correct ages being returned when age nearest birthday is asked for than when age last birthday or next birthday is asked for  This appears to have been the main idea at the back of the mind of the Census Joint Committee in the United Kingdom when at the Census of 1921  for the first time  ages were required to be given in years and months though the change was made not wuth the intention of tabulating ages in years and months   Taking up now the actual errors in the statement of ages at the Census ir is said that an investigation into these errors is a study in  idios mcrasy  It would  however  give some consolation if it could be proved that each succeeding Census   Whether the two digits are reallj  centres of attraction or repulsion is a matter that requires detailed examination and is dealt with lower in this section   \fANNEXUBE TO CHAPTER IV   120     ^AGE   showed that idiosyncrasy Vvas slowly yielding place to sanity  It was  however  impossible for me to make any investigation in this direction with the 1931 Census Ketums as by the time Government announced their intention to have the Actuarial Report in connection with this Census written by me the only available statistics were the ternary and septenary groups into which the individual Age Returns were straightaway sorted  Whether the ternary and septenary groupings could be modified so as to secure a more accurate balance of errors in each group is a “ Grouping ” in this section  but subject which I shall take up under the head of I cannot help observing here at the risk of repeating it that it will be undesirable to make the Census Analysis forego the demographic and psychological study which the distribution at each age out of a representative and random sample of 100 000 persons of each sex in each Province provides  6  The principal sources of error in Census Statistics are of Gvo kinds  namely  Minor Errors of short range  unbiassed in character  and  b  Major Errors of a biassed nature and wide range that produce considerable distortion  of the age   a   curve      The minor errors are attributable mainly to ignorance  7  Minor Errors Slany people  in a country predominantly ilhterate  are so indifierent as regards their age that  when questioned by the enumerator  they return round numbers which are primarily the nearest decennial ages and secondarily the nearest quinquennial ages  These errors are cyclical in character affecting ages which are multiples of 10 and 5 and recur  therefore  in cycles of ten  year age periods     It has been held  by an examination of the relatively large numbers returned at ages ending in 2 and 8 as compared with the respective adjoining ages  that 8   these digits are minor centres of attraction  meaning thereby that the numbers returned at these ages are more than the correct numbers at them  It is true that the preference for age 12 is so marked as tP throw in the shade the general preference for a multiple of 5 in the age period 10 20 and 8 is very often preferred to reference to the row “ Deviation ” in Tables age 5 in the period 0 10  and XI will show that  beyond the partiahty above indicated  preferences IX  for ages ending in 2 and 8 are not so very pronounced in the either sections of the decennial age periods  As a matter of fact  in most provinces  except Bengal  8 is a centre of repulsion  to a certain extent  All the other digits are repulsed in the order 6  4  7  3  9 and 1 as is evident from the results of the three Census Returns  A  X  X  The method of construcand XI above referred to  analysed in Tables IX  tion of these Tables  the conclusions to be drawn from a study of them regarding the magnitude of the attraction or repulsion for ages ending in the several digits from 0 to 9 and the order in which the various digits have been preferred are taken up in greater detail in a few paragraphs of this section occurring later  These nunor mis statements of age are removed by a good method of graduation and disappear if the population is grouped in suitable decennial age periods  9   Major Errors      The major     errors  that affect population statistics produc   ing serious distortion of the age curve and of the rates of mortality deduced therefrom  consist primarily of the transfer of persons from one age period to another and secondarily of substantial omissions in the Census Records especially in ages of infancy and childhood  10  If accurate records of deaths and  migration are maintained according to magnitude and locate the position the each age it might be possible to identify accuracy  by comparing the number of certain degree of these major error s to a Census with that returned at age x j 10 one returned at any age  say  x at suitable allowance making for deaths and Censu s by at the next decennial number had first been which the nfigration to subject in the distm bances due to to add that such an necessary It is hardly investigation intercensal period  is nextto impossible withthe pre sent condition of death and migration records in India  The se wilful mis statements are generally due tovanity especially in the case of old persons who generally give themselves the advantage of a few more years  There might also be financial reasons for overstatement at the old ages if the laws of the country pro^fide for an old age pension  In a certain number of cases these misstatements are also due to resentment against the personal nature of the questions  A digit is a centre of^epulsion when the number returned as of that digit is less than the gorrect number at it   \f      ACTUAMAL REPORT  and suspicion of their motives   12   Whatever may be the causes for these deliberate  mis statements they are ultimately traceable to ignorance not ignorance of age itself to which the minor errors are due but to ignorance of the fact that the Census Analysis does not deal with individuals but only with groups and the individuals are merged unidentifiably in the groups dealt with     At the appropriate place in this section comparisons will be effected between the extent and magnitude of the errors in age in India and those of some other countries where the level of education is decidedly higher than in India  The errors in the ages returned at the Censuses in India do not show any tendency to diminish and will not do so  so long as illiteracy permeates the population to the 11   extent it is now doing  We cannot expect better results till education spreads and as a natural result the ignorance of the people in matters relating to the Census Talking of this ignorance l Ir  G  H  Knibbs in a is substantially minimised  Paper read before the Poyal Statistical Society in 1920 said    It  would be easv to publish primers showing the purpose of a Census Such primers could readily or of the greater branches of Statistics  he prepared so as to be supplied to piimary and other schools in such a form as to serve the purpose of a systematic and most useful instruction which would be of instruction in Statistical Method popular recognition of the utility of way a business value  In this the work of securing accurate readily created and Statistics could be        data greatly facilitated  One would entirely agree with Mr  Knibbs  view that education relating to statistical enquiries of all kinds  which  to make them serve their high purpose  12   should be presented in an interesting form devoid of all dull series of numerical Tables  should form a compulsory part of the education  in his boyhood  of the future citizen  This will to a large extent mend the no moj e than a dilettante interest shown even by a person of more than average education in matters relating to the Census   On the Nature and Extent of the Errors in Age in Census Returns  13  In his Actuarial Report in connection with the 1911 Census the late Mr  T  G  Ackland illustrated the preference for particular digits of age by the following Table        TABLE IV  Showing in each of the six Provinces undermentioned the immbers out of a total of 1 000 returned in respect of each digit of age   also the naan  values for the six Provinces and the order in which

to show not only the magnitude of concentration ending in certain favourite digits but also the order in which the digits were preferred  Mr  Ackland drew his conclusions on the assumption that had correct ages been returned the number with respect to each digit shown in the Table would have been 100 being a tenth of the total population winch was reduced to 1000 for the purpose of this enquiry  In his Actuarial Report with the 1921 Census  Mr  Meikle did not publish any figures based on a similar analysis of the 14   at ages  \f   ANKEXUEE TO CHAPTER IV   122     ^AGE   1921 Census material but evidently indicated his acquiescence with the arguments and conclusions of Mr  Ackland by quoting the order of preference for each particular digit as deduced by the latter for the whole of India   The count evidently 15  There is however some fallacy in this method  commences at age 0 and a cycle is complete at age 9  At age 10 another cycle commences which is completed at age 19 and so on  Each age  therefore  ending with the digit  say  ^9 is nine years lower down the scale than age 0 of the same cycle and has therefore been depleted by deaths occurring in these nine years of hfetime  Had there been no preference for particular digits of age  that is  if people had returned their correct ages  even then the total number returned at ages having 9 in the unit’s place would have been considerably smaller than the number returned at ages ending in 0  There would have been a progressive and smooth diminution as we go downwards from age 0 to age 9  The method of analysis adopted at the 1911 Report does not make allowance for this progressive diminution due to mortality and therefore loads the scales against ages at the lower half of the cycle in favour of those at the upper hah  16   In illustration of the case in point  I have taken Mr  Ackland’s graduation  of the specimen schedule of 100 000 males of the Province of Bombay   The gra   duated numbers are smooth and do not exhibit any preference for any particular digit of age but only diminish smoothly from age to age due to the operation of mortahty  The results are set out in the following Table    TABLE V  Distribution of 100 000 Males of the Province of Bombay according to the digit of age in the unit’s place   1911 Census  Unit figure in age last birthday   A  B        9  0  1  2  3  4  6  6  7  8  12

at each digit beai’s to that at digit 9  The latter figures indicate that  without  showing any preference for ages ending in particular digits  the total population returned at ages ending in 0 should be 45%  those at ages ending in 1  35%  at 2  28%  etc   in excess of those returned at ages ending in 9  Hence  before conclusions are drawn  allowance should be made for this natural excess at all other digits as compared with the number at digit 9  17  Ill the row  ratio  A  method that eliminates this fallacy is to obtain for each digit the ratio 18  of the sum of the ungraduated to that of the graduated numbers at that digit and compare these ratios  It is not claimed that the graduated numbers represent absolute truth  A good method of graduation would produce figures which deviate  if at all  from the true figures w ithin the limits of errors due to random It can  therefore  be claimed that  where the original statistics are samphng  manifestly full of errors  the graduated figures represent as near an approach to the true figures as possible the greater the reliability of the original statistics the closer will be the graduated to the true figures     X  and XI appearmg on pages 128 130 show for the 19  The three Tables IX  six main Provinces of India in each of the three Censuses  1911  1901 and 1891  the numbers returned in resjiect of each digit of age

numbers are given  excess r  deficiency   in the next row and the row following show s the order in which the different digits have been preferred w hile returning ages obtained by a comparison of the ratio of the ungraduated to the graduated numbers  The last row gives the rank allotted to each digit by the method adopted at the 191  Analysis by a comparison of the size of the ungraduated numbers only without making anv ^ allowance for their progressive diminution due to the operation of mortality as explained above  I could not carry this enquiry down to the 1931 Census as with that Census  with which my w’ork is intimately connected  no returns at individual ages either of the of  1 000  ratios  in  of the     \fACTUARIAL REPORT   123  whole population or of samples  as I have several times said in this Report  are available  while with respect to the 1921 Census  though the numbers at individual ages of specimens are available  the graduated numbers are available only in groups  20  It should be observed at the outset  at the risk of repeating it  that digits should be allotted their rank in the order of record only by a comparison of the ratio of the ungraduated to the graduated numbers and not by a comparison of the In illustration of this magnitude of the absolute numbers representing deviation  point  we can take the digits 1 and 9 for the United Provinces at the 1911 Census  The ratio for the former digit is  4196 and for the latter  3837 which shows that out of every 10 000 males whose ages had 1 in the unit’s place only 4196 returned As for the digit 9 the ratio shows correct ages and the remaining 5804 other ages  that only 3837 out of 10 000 whose ages ended with 9 returned correct ages  It is now evident that  as between the two digits  ages ending with digit 9 were repelled by the U  P  males in 1911 more than ages ending with digit 1  If we had drawn our conclusions from the relative magnitude of the deviation for each digit we would have inferred that 9 was more popular than 1 in that Province  The deviations have their own use in giving a numerical measure of the magnitude of the error at each digit out of each sample of 1  000 of the population having the same age distribution as the total population  For instance  in such a sample of 1  000 persons in the United Provinces in 1911  as many as 112 persons would have been found at ages ending in the digit 1 of which only 47 retvrrned correct ages and the remaining 65 returned incorrect ages  The ratio of 65 to 112 is smaller than the ratio of 53 to 86 showing that the unpopularity of 1 inU  P  at the 1911 Census was less than that of 9 though the absolute figures of deviations for these digits are 65 and 53 The “ total deviation irrespective of sign ” gives the total number of respectively  males out of each representative sample of 1 000 persons that returned incorrect  ages   X  21  It will be seen  from a scrutiny of the figures in Tables IX  and XI  that ages ending with the digits 0  5 and 2 proved centres of attraction  Confining first our attention to the figures relating to All India in Table IX  it will be seen that as many as 141 per mille of the total population whose ages did not end with the digit 0 returned ages ending with that digit at the 1911 Census  This is the average figure for the whole of India and varies from a maximum of 175 in the United Provinces to a minimum of 68 in Burma  The magnitude of the plumpings at ages 0 in the other Censuses can be obtained similarly from the figures for these Censuses appearing in Tables and XI  The next popular digit is 5 though in the age period 10 19 age 12 has a greater degree of concentration than age 15  Next in rank in the order of preference comes the digit followed by 8  From an examination of the All India ratios for these 2  two digits in all the three Censuses  it will be seen that the numbers returned at these ages are very nearly accurate  The former is the centre of a small attraction though it has been consistently repelled by Burma  and by •Madras in two out of the three Censuses analysed  The latter is  if anything  a small centre of repulsion  In the 1891 and 1901 Censuses 1 per mille and 5 per mille respectively of the total population who were of an age ending with digit 8 repelled their true ages and returned other ages  At the 1911 Census  however  1 per mille of the total population whose age did not end with the digit 8 returned an age ending with that digit  Bengal alone  of all the Provinces  appears to have consistently shown a great partiality for these two digits  I feel it essential to emphasise the fact that the errors at ages ending in digits 2 and 8 are not very material  except at the single age 12 and the single age 8  as it appears to me that it has been assumed in the past that at ages ending in these two digits there has been a substantial overstatement of numbers   X  22  The other digits are definite centres of repulsion as in every one of thfem the actual numbers returned are less  in some considerably less  than the expected  or graduated numbers  The same fact is confirmed by the ratios apphcable to these digits either for the Provinces or for the whole of India as these ratios are in every case substantially less than unity  which  by the way  would have been the value of the ratio for any digit had correct numbers been returned at that digit  23  What might  however  prove of interest is the fact that the unpopularity of digits 6  7  8 and 9 appearing in the lower half of the cycle has been accentuated  and that of digits 1 M22CC     3 and 4 in the upper half masked by the method of comparison  \f124  ANNEXUKE TO CHAPTER IV   AGE   adopted at the 1911 Report which omitted to make allowance for the influence of mortality above referred to  For a similar reason the popularity of ages ending in 0 has been further magnified and that of ages ending in 5 not fully brought out by the inherent fault in the old method which compared the several digits as regards their popularity by the absolute magnitude of the crude figures returned at the Census  To take an example  it would appear  by paying attention only to the numbers returned at the Census  that in the Province of Bengal at the 1911 Census as many as 153 per mille of the total population who were not of ages ending with 0 returned such ages whereas the correct number as given by “ Deviation ” should be only 129  The ungraduated figure for digit 5 would indicate that the cluster round ages ending in 5 was only 87 per mille whereas the correct number is larger being 91  This method of basing conclusions from the magnitude of the crude figures only returned at the Census without allowing for the fall in numbers due to mortality from age to age did perhaps the greatest injustice to digit 5 as against digit 0 at the 1901 Census in the two Provinces of Bombay and Madras  I am not aware if it had been realised that in these two Provinces at the 1901 Census the cluster round ages ending in 5 was proportionately larger than  that round ages ending in digit 0  The ratios  which alone give the correct method of assessing the popularity of different digits  relating to these digits show that in the Province of Bombay at the 1901 Census the numbers returned at ages ending in 5 were 208 per cent  of the correct number whereas for digit 0 they were only 192 per cent  The corresponding percentages for Madras were 142 and 141  Since the absolute magnitude of the numbers returned at 0 is considerably larger than that at 5 it is very likely that the fact  that at the 1901 Census in the Ihovinces of Bombay and Madras  ages ending in digit 5 were more popular than ages ending in digit 0  thereby reversing the usual order of preference of these two digits  was overlooked  24  The method of comparing ungraduated Census figures has also reversed the relative positions of digits 1 and 9 and the latter has come in for a measure of unpopularity rather undeserved  It will be seen from a reference to Table IV that digit 9 has been given the last rank in the order of record for all the Provinces and uatiurally for the whole of India and digit 1 the next higher rank in almost all ProAunces and for the whole of India  while in the United Provinces this digit was given as high a rank as the 7th  It vdll  however  appear from a comparison of the sizes of the ratios that at the 1911 Census in all the Provinces and in the whole of India 9 was more popular than 1 except in the United Provinces where the order was reversed  A reference to all the three Tables IX  and XI will show that except in two instances  1901 Burma  and 1911 U  P   digit 9 always secured the 9th rank and 1 the last  viz   10th rank  thereby proving clearly the greater popularity of ages ending in digit 9 as compared with ages ending in digit 1  The other incorrect ranks allotted by the old method are aU indicated in Table IX   X  25  Exigencies of space and time forbid my making any further elaboration on this subject relating to the order in which ages ending in the different digits were preferred at the three Censuses that have been analysed for this study  It is  however  necessary to state in closing this topic that the other odd numbers excluding 5 were preferred in the order 3  7  9 and 1 and not in the order 3  7  1 and 9  as made out in the older Reports  As between digits 3 and 7 it is not quite decisive which of the two is the more popular  Each is repelled practically to the same extent as is eAudent by the extreme closeness of the ratios relating to these two digits in all the three Censuses for the whole of India   26  As regards how far these errors show a tendency to diminish  I fear  I am not in a position to make any statement that would show a satisfactory state of things  Information in this respect is given by the numbers called “ total deviaand XI  For the whole of India tion irrespectiA e of sign ” in Tables IX  about 522 per mille of the male population returned incorrect ages at the 1891 Census which happily dwindled down to 376 at the 1901 Census but at the 1911 Census the number rose again to 466  If we examine partiFor instance  the concentration cular digits the same tendency is revealed  at age 0 at the 1891 Census AA as 166 per miUe which diminished to 108 at the 1901 Census and again rose to 141 in 1911  It will be found that in the case of all Provinces except Burma there has been a set back in this respect from the 1901 It is not possible to say hoAV far Burma has been consistent to the 1911 Census   X  \f          125  ACTUARIAL REPORT   ex in the tendency for improvement it has shown  as this Province  for reasons Analysis  Actuarial 1891 in the not included Hardy  was George by Sir plained Madras which showed a very large de dation of 562 at the 1891 Census was remarkably accurate at the 1901 Census  for  at that Census only 180 per mille of the  shown  At the 1901 Census the accuracy total male population gave incorrect ages  that of all the other Pro  inces including superior to substantially was Madras by Burma  But it has since taken fast strides in the retrograde direction as will be evident from the large number  450 per mille  that returned incorrect ages at the 1911 Census  This figure  though significantly smaller than the figures of the shows other Provinces excluding Burma  is almost double that of Burma and the by Madras as exactly two and a half times worse off in this respect as judged necessary standard set up by Madras itself at the 1901 Census  It is not  I hope  to make further comments as the figures of ratios ’  deviation and total deviation irrespective of sign tell their owui tale  The general conclusion to be drawn from a scrutiny of these figures is that the tendency towards improvement shown by all the Provinces from 1891 to 1901 practically vanished in 1911 Burrna alone being an exception  MTiat has happened since 1911 I am not in a position to pronounce any opinion upon backed by Statistical Analysis  as  for reasons I have already explained more than once  it has not been possible for me to make any investigations in this direction wuth the 1921 and 1931 Census materials  ‘  ‘  ’  ’     27  It has often been held  not without justification  that the magnitude of these errors is directly correlated with the percentage of illiteracy in a country  It might  therefore  be instructive to compare in this respect India with some repre   sentative countries of the world  An easy method of comparison is obtained by using the “ Index of Concentration ” de ’ised by the United States Census Bureau  By this method the number of persons between 23 and 62 years whose ages are returned as multiples of 5 is compared wfith one fifth of the total number between the two ages  The method is based on the justifiable assumption that had there been no concentration on multiples of 5 these two figures would be “ about equal The limits 23 and 62 were selected as they covered the period in which the concentration under investigation was most marked  The method suffers  to a certain extent  from the same disadvantage as attaches to that adopted at the 1911 Actuarial Analysis in proving the order of preference for particular digits of age  Since  however  numbers ending in 5 and 0 are symmetrically placed in each cycle that commences with 3 and ends udth 2  any bias in favour of 5 introduced Again  by the method is neutrahzed by the bias contrariwise against 0  since the small error yet attaching to the method affects more or less equally all the cmmtries  comparison of one country  with another is not   itiated by The following Table effects such a comparison in which the total for this method  multiples of 5 is expressed as a percentage of the total for all ages from 23 to 62 and is taken from the 1921 Report for the Province of Bombay by IMr  Sedgwick  It should  however  be stated that 100 w ould mean no concentration at all and 500  the maximum value of the index  would mean that all ages returned between 23 and 62 were multiples of 5   TABLE VI

scrutiny of the above Tables will make it evident how very slight the bunchings are in Australia at ages ending in 0 and 5 as compared with the pronounced cluster round these ages in The same characteristic might also be noted at ages which are centres of India  repulsion  The chief reason why these Tables are given here is to show that  whereas in Australia there is a jironounced tendency for the ratios relating to each digit to approach unity  that is  for the errors in age  already very small  to show a definite tendency towards diminution  no such tendency is exhibited by the figures relating I have only to repeat what I have already observed that thougii 1901 to India  Census figures showed some improvement on those of 1891  the figures relating to the 1911 Census indicated a definite move in the retrograde direction as is also e V’ident from Table VIII   rroinpiug   Germane to the subject of error ^ in age is tiiar of the groupings to be adopted to minimise the effect of the accidental errors that affect Age Returns  This is  however  a topic on which opinion is divided and whether one partciular method or  30   another is to be preferred will depend on the certainty with which it will be possible to say how far the statistics collected are afflicted with errors of overstatement or understatement and whether the range of these errors is short or long  The central idea underlying all methods of grouping is that groups should be formed as far as possible containing the popular age along with the adjoining ages from  which the former has drawn numbers so that  though returns at individual ages may be incorrect  the total of the group may be considered reasonably correct and the group totals are used as the basic data for any subsequent investigations  The most satisfactory grouping is that which makes the deviations between the total in each group and the ideal total in that group that would have been evident had correct  \fACTUARIAL REPORT   127  ages been returned a minimum  We are then faced with the problem of giving due weight to the rival claims of two considerations each acting contrary to the other  With the view to minimise the errors left over in them it is desirable to form large groups on the other hand  large groups may have the effect of obscuring peculiar conditions prevailing in the decennium affecting only short range or ranges in the age curve     31   Had the plumpings been confined only to ages ending in 0  groups 5 14   15 24  etc   would deal effectively with such errors on the assumption that the concentration at ages ending in 0 is only drawn from the adjoining four or fi  e ages on  The records of deaths of England and Wales were presented in this either side  form for many years  Since  however  ages ending in 5 are also secondary centres of disturbance  the decennial groups above referred to will have to be abandoned in favour of quinquennial groups  Had there been concentrations of equal intensity at ages 0 and 5  groups 3 7  8 12  etc   wherein the digit of concentration occupies the central position in each group would have been satisfactory  Indian Census Returns have  however  indicated concentration of greater intensity at all decennial ages than at quinquennial ones  This is the main point of criticism against this method added to which is the fact that ages ending in 2 which are also favoured to a certain extent occur at the end of alternate groups  In what follows this will be referred to as the 3 7 group  Had the concentrations at the two favourite digits been due to systematic over  statements of ages only  groups 1 5  6 10  etc   would have eliminated them  Similarly groups 0 4  5 9  etc   would have satisfactorily dealt with understatements  Except  however  at particular short periods of bfe there is no reason why systematic over statement or under statement alone should affect the Age Returns  The former nudhod  0 4 group  had been adopted in the past as the standard one for grouping and presenting Census figures  This was condenm ^d by my predecessor  Mr  Meikle  as the least accurate of all the methods of grouping and I find myself in entire agreement with his condemnation of the method as 1 shall show lower down in the course of this enquiry  1 should also make special mention here of the great service rendered   y Mr  Meikle to the cause of Indian Census by focussing attention on this important subjec t of grouping  The recommendations made by him  though in my opinion could be improved upon  were decidedly in the nature of improvements on the old methods  There are two more grounin gs namely  2 6  7 11  etc   and 4 8  9 13  etc  Five different methods of grouping have altogether been mentioned respecri vely designated as 0 4  1 5  2 6  3 7 and 4 8 gi oui   s  We can also call 0 4 grouping as the 1st place method de Ugnatiug the methotl of g  oujiing by the position of the

therefore  be desirable to slightly diminish the number of age   grouped along wutb an age ending in 0 and inciease coriespondingly die numbei  grouped along widi an age ending in 5  Since there is markedly greater concentradou about ages ending in 0 than about 5  the number of ages in the former group should be larger than at the latter very nearly in proportion to the relative concentradons  I have  therefore  considered the claim for recognition of the following   nuaternarv  M22CC     s    \f           ANNEXURE TO CHAPTER TV   128     ^AGE   and senary groupings in conjunction with age

into two equal halves the numbers returned at all ages ending in 3 and 7  One half of the number other half at an age ending m 3 will be taken with the upper senary group and the  is last  with the

possible to include the Punjab in the 1891 Analysis as the ages next birthday were tabulated for that Province at that Census   \fACTUARIAL REPORT   131  35  It will be desirable here to say a few words about the two criteria by which the suitability of any method of grouping is generally tested  The first criterion is what is called “ goodness of fit ”  According to this criterion that method of grouping is the best which yields values at individual ages which deviate the least in the aggregate from the originally observed values  The second criterion relates to “ smoothness ” and helps to single out that method of grouping as the best which makes the values progress smoothly from one group to another  36  Each of the first five methods of grouping was the subject of more than one severe test in the past with the view to find out which of them gave the most satisfactory result  In that gigantic work in connection with the preparation of Life Tables for the United States of America for 1890  1901  1910 and 1901 1910  Mr  James W  Grlover  Professor of Insurance in the Lmiversity of Michigan  conducted elaborate investigations with the statistics relating to the male population in the State of New York estimated as of July 1910 and the deaths of the three year period 1909 1911   In testing “ goodness of fit ” his first method was to obtain the rates of mortality for all ages from 15 to 85 by a method of osculatory interpolation when the population and the deaths w ere combined according to each of the five quinquenThese rates were compared with the rates of mortality obtained nial age groups  from the average of these five sets of graduated populations and statistics of deaths  The smallness of the deviations and the frequency with which these deviations changed sign were made the criterion by which to judge which method of grouping gave the most satisfactory result  By his second method he obtained the deviations of the expected from the actual deaths for each of the five methods of grouping  His third criterion was to consider that method of grouping the best which made the weighted squared deviations of the graduated values from the observed values a minimum  Each of the three methods detailed above can only be of theoretical 37   interest to us in India so long as the records of Vital Statistics are in the present  state of unreliabihty  38  Instead of comparing the rates of mortality as deduced by every one of the methods of quinf uennial grouping with the average for all groupings or with the  observed rates of mortality as Professor Glover did because the data supplied to  him comprised inter alia dependable statistics of deaths  I had  in the absence of no other option but to compare the actual numbers in each group for each method with the corresponding expected  or what is the same thing graduated  number  Whatever may be the actual groups in which the original statistics are collected they have to be finally transformed to the 0 4 groups  1st place method   This is more or less essential as the Age Statistics of most other countries and of India  itself have all been published in this form and if anv other method of grouping be adopted for the final presentation of population figures  comparisons with other countries and with past Censuses of India itself  which are always of very great value in Census study  would be practically impossible  The three Tables XV  XVI and XVII appearing at the end of this section show for the All India Males in each of the three Censuses  1891  1901 and 1911  the deviations between the actual numbers returned at the Censuses and the graduated numbers in 5 9  10 14  etc   groups for all the methods of grouping  It will be seen that  according to all the other methods except the first  the original statistics are not collected in 0 4 groups  i e   according to the 1st place method   All the other six methods were transformed from their respective groups to the 0 4  etc   groups which  as observed above  is desirable with the view to effect useful comparisons with other Census Statistics   this desideratum   39  A word of explanation as to how this transformation from the original grouping to the 0 4 grouping should be effected may be necessary  Taking for instance the 2nd place method  the group  say  4 8 should part with a fifth of the total ungraduated number in that group to the previous group and obtain a fifth of the total ungraduated number from the following  namely  9 13 group  The result can very nearly be taken to be the 5 9 group and so on for transforming otlier groups  Similarly the 3rd place method of grouping should cede the population relating to ages ending in 3 and 4 to the prei eding group and obtain the population relating to ages ending in 8 and 9 from the succeeding group  Each group should therefore cede two fifths of its number to the preceding group and °  M22CC  \f   ANNEXUBE TO CHAPTER IV   132     ^AGE   obtain two fiftbs of the number in the succeeding group  The adjustments to be made to the 4th and oth place methods of grouping to transform them to the 1st place method should now be evident  40  The assumption is made in this process of transforming one group into another that the numbers in all the ages in a quinquennial group are equal and no allowance is made for the progressive diminution of the population from age to age I have  however  satisfied myself that except at the ages of infancy in that grouin and childhood and at the extreme old ages  say  above 70  the resulting error is of small magnitude  At the early ages  however  statistics of population should be tabulated according to single age periods and at the very old ages the statistics are usually combined into a single group  say  70 and over  It will  therefore  be evident that at those age periods where the grouping device is adopted to minimise the effects of minor mis statements of age the error introduced by the above assumption is of no great moment  The ternary septenary and the quaternary senary methods of grouping are transformed easily into 0 4  etc   groups by the dichotomous process explained by iVIr  Meikle with re spect to the former method of groupBy this method group s are formed by taking the sum ing which he advocated  of one half of any two consecutive groups and the resulting new groups are of  the 0 4  5 9  etc   type   “  The smallness of the number called total deviation without sign ” is the basis by which to judge each of the seven methods for the first criterion  namely  “ goodness of fit This number shows the sum of the deviations  whether in excess or in defect  of the recorded numbers from the graduated numbers when the former in each of the six methods of grouping  except of course the first which is in the required form  are finally transformed into 0 4  5 9  etc   groups by processes of which full explanation was given above  The algebraic sum of the deviations does not provide the criterion by which to judge the methods  as two deviations  one very large and positive and another negative and equal or very nearly equal  41   would produce a small algebraic sum of the deviations in spite of the large error of the observed number in each case from the ideal number  Judged by the criterion of the smallness of the “ total deviation without sign ” it will be evident that the  4th place method  2 6  7 11  etc   groilps  is foremost in rank of all the seven methods considered  The sum of the deviations irrespective of sign is the smallest Second in rank as for this method in each of the three Censuses considered  regards acc uracy is the ‘‘ Quaternary and Senary ” method explained in detail earlier method shows itself as slightly in this section though the “ Ternary and Septenary superior at the 1891 Census  but this is more than compensated for by the very It will large differences in the other two Censuses in favour of the former method  be of interest to note that the 1st place method  0 4  etc   groups  shows the largest deviation of all the seven methods in all the three Censu ses  • This is the method of grouping of the population that had been adopted in the past and Mr  Meikle was quite justified in condemning this method as the least accurate of all the methods of 43  population statistics in India  grouping 42  I felt it might be of interest to ascertain which of the seven methods gave  the least deviation between graduated and ungraduated numbers in their original group s themselves before the transformation into 0 4  etc   groups was effected  The results are set out in the following Table    TABLE Xll   A ll India Males  Total deviation without sign   Year of Census   1891 1901 1911  1st

figures of deviations in the above  Table that 2 6 method shows the lea st deviation between ungraduated and graduated numbers before the original group ^ in which the population statistics are ‘  ’    This test is usually adopted to judge the closeness of fit of the  ones   Here  however  it has to be used contrariwise   graduated numbers to the observed  \fACTUAKIAL EEPOBT   133  surmned are altered to produce the 0 4 groups  In one instance  1891  when the errors in age were very large in magnitude  the Ternary and Septenary method shows a deviation smaller than the 2 6 method  But this is more than compensated for by the large difference between the deviations of the two methods The deviations appearing in favour of the 2 6 method at the other two Censuses  in the above Table do not provide a very important criterion by which to judge the methods as ultimately all the six methods  except the first  are altered to the group‘  ’  ‘  ‘  ’  ’  ings of the first one   As for the second criterion  namely  “ smoothness ” by which to judge the methods of grouping  it is satisfactory to be able to say that I have been able to adopt the same method of analysis as was adopted by Professor Glover with the population The smoothstatistics relating to the United States of America above referred to  44   ness of a series of values grouped in five ages is tested by the regularity of progression of the ratio     G  where  ts  “T  5  is  the total for ages from x to a     4   f 5  Such ratios were formed from 0 4 groups for each of the seven methods of grouping considered  As when testing the methods for “goodness of fit” the groupings in such of them  six in number  as were not originally in the 0 4 groups were transformed to these groups  Where the earliest age in a quinquennial group in the numerator of the above ratio is a multiple of 10 the ratio is called oM   and where the earliest age is a multiple of 5 it is called gM^   For instance  the ratio ‘  inclusive   ’     ‘  G   ’  Go  is called  Mo is called olVUo and the ratio The  ^30 ^15 ^20 ^25 ^ three Tables XVIII  XIX and give the values of oM   and 5 M  for each of the seven methods of grouping in each of the three Censuses 1891 1901 and 1911          I  XX  ^  and 5M 1 and the difference between the average values below each method of grohping  To make it easy to understand that the method which gives smooth progression of the grouped values is that for which the difference between the average value of oM  and 5M  for the graduated population in each is a minimum  the values of oMx and Census are also given  The graduated numbers of the population progress smoothly from age to age and therefore the quinquennial groups formed from them should That they do so is demonstrated by the extremely small also progress smoothly  magnitude of the difference between the average value of 31 ^ and 5M   for the graduated population in each of the three Censuses considered  The seven methods of grouping population statistics under consideration are arranged in each Table according to the smoothness of progression of the grouped values judged by the criterion of the smallness of the difference between the average value of qIM   and  The average values of  of these quantities are given     The first rank of the 2 6 method amongst all the seven methods consiThe “Quaternary and Senary ” method secures the second rank and the “ Ternary and Septenary ” method the third  It is not by a narrow margin that the 2 6 method secures the first rank  Even at the 1911 Census where the “ Quaternary and Senary ” method which is always second in rank makes the closest approach to the 2 6 method  the difference between the according to the former is more than 50 per cent  larger and average 45   ‘  ’  dered will be evident   ‘  ’  ‘  ’  than the corresponding difference of the latter  What may be of interest is that the 0 4 method  the method of grouping population statistics adopted so far  in addition to occupying uniformly the last rank in all the three Censuses shows 2 6 at each Census a figure of difference several times larger than that of the method and in the 1901 Census it was very nearly 20 times as large  The method  therefore  so far adopted in grouping population statistics has been the least accurate of all the methods considered from every point of view  ’  ‘  ’  ‘  As a result of his analysis  Prof  Glover rejected the ‘0 4’ and 1 5 methods as unsuitable and was not able to pronounce as decisive an opinion in favour of one of the other three methods  2 6 ’  3 7 and 4 8’  as it has been possible to do with the analysis on Indian Age Keturns for the main reason that the mis statements of age in the American Census Returns are not so pronounced    j   46   ’  ‘  ‘  ‘  ’  ‘  He ultimately decided in favour of the 4 8 as in the case of the Indian Returns  method and his arguments for so doing may be quoted in his own words  “ How3 7 ’ and 4 8 still remains a problem  ever  the decision as to groups 2 6 ’  ’  ‘  ‘  ‘  ‘  ’  As between these three groups it will be observed that groups M22CC  ‘  2 6  ’  and  ‘  3 7  ’  \f   AlWEXURE TO CHAPTEB IV   184   ^AGE   contain both the ages ending in the digits 0 and 8 in the same quinquennial age group while the adjacent five year groups contain the ages ending in the digit 5  This tends to exaggerate unduly alternate quinquennial age groups in these sets  With the group 4 8 however  the ages ending in the digits 5 and 8 are in the same quinquennial group and the ages ending in the digit 0 are in the adjacent five year groups  Since the exaggeration for ages which are multiples of 10 is undoubtedly greater than for ages which end in the digit 5  the group 4 8 would seem to furnish a better balanced grouping than the group 2 6 or 3 7 ‘  ’  ‘  ’  ‘  ’  ‘  47  It will be evident from Prof  Glover’s arguments that the chief reason why he 4 8’ grouping is the fact that in U  S  A  Age Returns ages decided in favour of the ending in digit 8 formed definite centres of attraction next in popularity after the two digits 0 and 5  To secure  therefore  a better balance of tlie errors between two consecutive quinquennial groups he decided to keep the most favoured digit 0 in one group and the next two favoured digits 5 and 8 together in the adjacent quinquennial group  The late iMr  George King who analysed the population of Englandand Wales with the 1911 Census also pronounced in favour of the ‘4 8’ method as his analysis also revealed that ages ending in digit 8 were nearly as favoured as ages ending in 5 which is shown by the following Table ‘     TABLE XIll  a  England and Wales  Males  Digit of age   0  Ratio of recorded to graduated

  995  1 004  1 003   967  1 033  1 000  Ratio to digit 9  shown  as  by  Mr  King  48   The results of three Australian Censuses appearing in Table VII also indi   cate concentration at ages ending in 8 of an intensity next only to ages 0 and 5  49  Apart from the fact that the results of the analysis to which the three Censuses have been subjected have indicated the decided superiority of the 2 6 ’ method of grouping over all the other methods taken in the comparison  we could have  on precisely the same arguments as induced Messrs  Glover and King to decide in favour of the 4 8 ’ method  pronounced in favour of the 2 6 ’ method  Their ‘  ‘  ‘  chief argument was that the second and third favoured digits  5 and 8  should appear in one quinquennial group to balance the pronounced concentration at digit 0 which is the first favourite  Tables IX  and XI appearing in this section  X  have clearly indicated that in India digit 2 is the third favourite after 0 and 5 and not digit 8  50   We should  therefore  include digits 2 and 5 in the same quinquennial group   and the 1 5 methods are the only two that satisfy this condition but The the latter having an age of pronounced concentration at the end of a group can be pima facie rejected as unsuitable  leaving the choice only on the 2 6 method  ‘  2 6  ’  ‘  ’  ‘  ’  51  We are now in a position to see why the 2 6 method gives results  judged by any criterion  markedly superior to all the other methods  Any two consecutive groups of this method are formed from the two sets of digits  2  3  4  5  6 and 7  8  9  0  1  It was shown earlier in this section that as between the two digits 3 and 7 it was not quite decisive which was repelled the more  These two ‘  ’  digits appearing one along with digit 5 in one group and the other along with digit  0 in the other introduce  in so far as they are concerned  balancing errors in two adjacent groups  The marked concentration at digit 0 as compared with digit 5 should then be neutralized by combining with the former digits relatively unpopular as compared with those combining with the latter  The 2 6 method of grouping is able to effect this as digits 1 and 9 which are the least liked of the ten digits are grouped along with 0 as against 4 and 6 grouped with 5  The combination of 2 with the 5 group and that of 8 with the 0 group serve as the final correcting factor ‘  in this respect   ’  \f   AOTUABIAL EEPOBT   135  Recommendations for adoption at the 1941 Census      They say that figures speak more emphatically and 52   a  Grouping  convincingly than words and if that is so  it can be claimed that the unique position method of grouping amongst all the seven methods considered  in of the ‘ 2 6 minimising the effects of mis statements of age in population statistics  has been established beyond any pale of doubt  I  therefore  very strongly recommend its being adopted at the 1941 Census  ’  53  6  ^^re  ^The method of grouping recommended is particularly easy to adopt age last birthday is asked for at the Census  The change made in the 1931 Census of asking people to return their age on nearest birthday  though theoretically expected to diminish significantly the errors in the ages returned  does not appear to have had the desired effect  This is evident from the distribution according to each age at the 1931 Census of a sample of 100 000 persons of each sex of the Presidency of ^Madras and the Punjab which alone were forwarded to me as the available statistics showing the distribution of any sample at individual Amongst the larger Indian States the Census Commissioner for Baroda ages  has given age distribution of the population at individual ages  These samples indicate the same degree of concentration  as in the earlier Censuses  at the usual favourite digits  Had the change made in this respect at the 1931 Census any effect at all  the concentration at ages ending in 0 should have been more or less equally divided between ages ending in 0 and 1  for  if a person returns his or her completed age as a favourite figure  say  30  it is as likely that the person has passed more than six months since completing age 30 as less than six months  If  therefore  all those persons  who usually give ages clustering round numbers ending in digits 0 and 5 when age last birthday is asked for  were to give a moment’s thought to the change in the age to be returned because what is asked  for is no longer age last birthday but nearest birthday  very nearly one half of them would have returned nearest ages ending in 0 and the other half those ending in 1  This would have had the effect of very nearly levelling up the concentration at digits ending in 0 by dividing it more or less equally between ages ending in 0 and 1  For a similar reason the concentration at ages ending in 5 should have been more or less equally divided between ages ending in 5 and 6  The statistics to which reference has been made do not exmbit any such tendency as the following Table for Madras clearly indicates thereby confirming the statement made at an earher part of this section that people were not in the least influenced by the age asked for being last birthday  nearest birthday or next birthday     if  TABLE XIV    Males   Madras  Numbers returned at each digit of age out of a total population of 1000

made in the 1931 Census in recording the age  On the other hand  the deficiency at 6 has been the largest at 1931 of all the four Censuses  54  It has been observed in other countries that the form of the age enquiry has an appreciable influence on the accuracy of the Age Keturns  Dr  A  A  Young  in his Report on ages at the 12th U  S  A  Census  appUed a test to the data of several countries some of which obtained ages in years  others in years and months and a third set actually called for the date of birth  He concluded  as a result of his test  that the statistics were most dependable when the date of birth was called for   55  To call for the date of birth will be an impossibility for several decades in the Census history of India  At the same time  while returning ages to the enumerator  people’s minds should be set about thinking for a while instead of  \f       ANNEXXJBE TO CHAPTER IV   136     ^AGE   returning any age at random  I should  therefore  recommend ages being called The enumerator should write for in completed number of years and months  however  in his form the number of completed years and months  While grouping  ignored  W^e should be months according to the 2 6 plan recommended  the groupmethod of the to suited shall thereby get the age last birthday which is best ing recomrnended without in any way sacrificing the accuracy  if any  that might accrue to the Age Statistics by calling for something more than mere age last birthday  In those cases where the number of months passed since the last birthday cannot be obtained it is immaterial as the grouping is according to the completed number of years  that is  age last birthday  only  I do not make myself bold to say that the suggested method of asking for age last birthday and the number of months completed since last birthday will have any metamorphic efiect at the 1941 Census  It might  however  have some effect of slowly curing the Age Returns of its ills as decades pass on  as otherwise  with the existing system of calling only for ages whether last birthday  next birthday or nearest birthday  the malady shov s no signs of coming under control  If  however  it is considered too early in the Census history of India to burden the schedule with ages and months  though the latter are to be ignored in the grouping  the age ’ last birthday with the suggested 2 6 method of grouping could be depended methods of grouping  other the of all results best give the upon to ’     ‘  In adopting the 2 6 method of grouping  returns for ages 0  1  2  etc   up to 6 last birthday

 SECTION IV  2   In tliis section I sliall attempt a brief description of the methods adopted in 1 the constiiiction of mortality Tables for the various Provincial groups detailed in the opening pages of this Report with some discussion on topics relevant thereto   man  earlier section of this Report  that  in view of the condiIt was explained the decennium prevailing in 1921 1931  the Table of mortality of each area was tions to embody the experience of this decennium only  The statistics of population used therefore were only those relating to the 1921 and 1931 Censuses without any  to i‘arher enumerations  The population of each area at the 1931 Census is available for nearest age on Census dai  this having been the age asked for according to instructions to enumerators for ages 0  1  2 and 3 stated separately and in alternate ternary and septenary groups 4 6  7 13  14 16  17 23  etc   to 67 73 with one large group at the end of 74 and over  The passage from ternary and septenary groups to the oi dinary rpiintjuciinial age groups 0 4  5 9  etc   is effected very    asilv by taking half the sura of two consecutive age groups  For instance  the age group 5 9 is obtained by taking the sum of one half of the ternary group 4 6 and one half of the septenary group 7 13  It should also be noted that the resulting quinary group 5 9  on the assumption that the ages returned were the ages nearest birthday  would include all persons whose ages were 5  6  7  8 and 9 last birthday  In this way the statistics of the population returned at the 1931 Census were arranged in quinquennial age periods 0 4  5 9  etc   to 65 69 with one large group at the end of 70 and ovej according to age last bu’thday in conformity with the metliod of grouping adopted at the pievious enumerations in India to facilitate comparison  The numbers in each age group were reduced by a constant ratio so as to produce a total of 100 000 for all ages   reference              Correction for Moi tality  3  The method described above of redistributing the original ternary and septenary age groups into quinary groups inti oduces an error though not very material due to the fact that in the  process of redistribution the assumption has been made that the numbers relating to each age in each septenary and ternary group are equal to one another and no allowance has been made foi  the progressive diminution of these numbers as age increases in each grou r due to the operation of mortal it           4  To allow for this error Mr  Meikle recommended certain irercentages being transferred from groups like 10 14  20 24  30 34  etc   to the respective earlier groups  I have  howevei   to state with regret that I have not been 5 9  15 19  25 29  etc  able to satisfy myself as to how quinquennial gr oups with the earliest age a multiple of 10 like 20 24  30 34  etc   alone have to part with ceitam peicentages to the respective earlier groups  Taking  for instance  the transformed quinarv gi oup 30 34 one can easily see that this age group is made up of the lower half of fye septenary group 27 33 and the upper half of the ternary group 34 36  In so far as it is made up of the lower half of the septenary group 27 33 it owes a certain number to the upper half of the same septenary group which is amalgamated with the quinary group 25 29  Again in so far as this age group 30 34 is made up of the upper half of the ternary group 34 36 it took rather less than its correct quota from that group when it was bisected and the upper half taken with the 30 34 group and the lower half with the 35 39 group  I think therefore any age gr’oup like 30 34 owes a certain number to the previous age group 25 29 and has to get another number from the succeeding age group 35 39  This is the case with respect to all transformed quinary groups  It is true that age groups like 30 34  40 44 and so on with the earliest number in the gi oup a multiple of 10 owe to the respective oreceding quinar   groups more than what they have to get from the succeeding ones with the result that on final adjustment they have to meet with a net duninution  But if we fleal with the net diminution only and transfer this net amount entirely to the upper age group we shall be  what in common parlance is called  “ robbing  Peter to pay Pa rrl” and orrr final adjustments will not be quite correct in transferring nunfyer s from one age gr Oup to another to that degree of approximation which it is desirable to ha^ e if mortality correction is to be given effect to  5  I ha^ e  on the same assumption as made by Mr  Meikle which is accurate enough for our present purpose  calculated this mortality correction to be applied  \fAXNEXURE TO CHAPTER IV   140   AGE   I shall represent by the symbol the total number in the septenary group of which 30 is the middle age and so on for other septenary groups  Similarly igs represents the total in the ternary group of which 25 is the middle age and so on for other ternary groups  The total number Sg^ in the septenary group 27 33  for instance  can be assumed approximately to be distributed at each of the seven ages in that group as follows  to each group       30   l j 3 g go  as of nearest age 27   7  30  1   2     5 3o   as of nearest age 28    30   1   73 o  as of nearest age 29   as of nearest age 30    30  1   30  q^o   as of nearest age 31    1   2   1   3 q^  as of nearest age   30  as of nearest age 32   33   7  The uppei  half of the above distribution relating to the age group from exact age 26^ to exact age 30 should contain  the q s denoting rates of mortality throughout   30   30   30    373o v   1   1  7    2 ^ 30        l gr 33   i 7  7    wWch  30     is  equal  to  ^  Sgo     7  f  30 30Instead  therefore  of taking I S30 7  3o   3o relating to the upper half of the septenary group 27 33 and i lower half  the method of   f 3o 3o bisection takes i to both the halves  It will therefore be evident that age group 30 34 has to cede s^^^q^ to the group 25 29  Considering similarly the ternary group 34 3 5 it can easily be seen by a similar analysis that the group 30 34 has to get ^ ^ 35^ 35 from the group 35 39  The whole scheme of correction is given in the following Table      it  Quinquennial age group   Should give to the preceding quinquennial group   Should get from the

from the 1911 Actuarial Report relating to the Province  Where any Provincial group is dealt with for the first time the rates of mortality relating to the whole of India were taken  6  The population of each area according to the 1921 Census is available in the usual 0 4  5 9  etc   groups according to age last birthday  With the view  however  to bring the population statistics of 1921 in conformity with those of 1931  ternary and septenary groups were formed from the sample of 100 000 for each sex available in respect of each area  These samples are available for each Census unit  To obtain samples applicable to each of the ten large geographical groups for which separate mortality Tables were to be constructed  the distribution according to each age in each Census unit was weighted according to the population in that unit and a new sample applicable to the geographical area dealt with was formed  7   For instance  the Madras group is composed of the following Census units  o   The British Province  of     Madras  including the small States of Pud   ukkottah  Banganapalli and Sandur    6   c   Mysore State  Travancore State    d   Cochin State    e   Coorg   The sample age distribution out of a total of 100 000 for each sex in each of the above areas was weighted at each age according to the population  taken to the nearest million  in that area and the sum of the products thus obtained was divided by the sum of the weights  In this manner was formed the sample distribution at each age out of a total population of 100 000 in each sex for each of the ten large areas into which the whole of India  including Burma  was divided for  the purpose of this analysis  I have also made suitable adjustments to transform each ternary and septenary age group of the 1921 population in each area from age last birthday to age nearest birthday  From the ternary and septenary age groups  quinary groups 0 4  5 9  etc   for ages last birthday were formed in the same manner as with the 1931 Return  Migration   Allowance was made at this stage for the disturbance caused by migration in the case of those Provincial groups where it was of such magnitude as to affect the rate of increase of the population or its age distribution  Taking India as a whole  for its size and the magnitude of its population  immigration and emigration  as observed by the Census Commissioner  Dr  Hutton  are practically unimportant  The direct effect of dividing India into ten large sections including British Provinces and the adjoining States has been to neutralize the large movement of population between contiguous political divisions where these are grouped together  The grouping has rendered ineffective  for instance  making any allowance for the presence of the large number of Bengalis in Assam and Madrasis in Mysore  Travancore and Cochin States and vice versa  In the Provincial groups of Madras and the United Provinces and in the group Bengal and Assam  migration  in spite of the neutralizing force above referred to  was too significant to be ignored  In the case of the first two groups the balance of migration was adverse in each of the two Censuses taken in 1921 and 1931  The total number of net emigrants per 100 000 of the total population at the respective Censuses in the case of each of these two Provincial groups was added to the quinquennial gi’oups above referred to representing age distribution per 100 000 of total population in each sex  The age distribution of the migrant population was taken to be the same as was e stimated by Sir George Hardy in 1891 by reference to the three Provinces  Coorg  Berar and Lower Burma where the immigrant population was relatively very large  Sir George has given full explanation of the methods followed by him in his 1891 Report  In the case of the Provincial group  Bengal and Assam  the balance of migi ation was in favour  The disturbance caused in the case of Bm ma by the presence in that Province of a large immigrant male population was eliminated by confining my investigation to Buddhists only who form almost entirely the indigenous population of that Provmce engaged almost exclusively in agricultural pursuits and of a non migratorj  temperament  In this respect my investigation has fallen in line with all the earlier ones a nd 8   \fAKNEXUEE TO CHAPTER IV   142     ^AGE   The Burman Buddhists have been observed in the past  as has also been confirmed by my investigation  to experience mortality markedly superior to that of Hindus or Muhammadans  To have combined the Buddhists of Burma with those following other religions wordd have introduced an element of heterogeneity in the investigation very much undesuable  The assumed age distribution of the emigrant population in the case of Madras and the United Provinces and of the immigrant population of Bengal and Assam enabled the correction due to migration disturbances being easily applied in each age group to the population of these Provincial groups in 1921 and 1931 respectively  The corrected population in each Census was again proportioned for in each quinary group relative to a total of 100 000 and the arithmetic mean of the two corrected populations was obtained in each age group  it is desil able that it should do so from another point of view   Graduation  It is now necessary to graduate or adjust the figures in each quinary group  9   of the mean population   obtained by processes described above  with the view to remove or at best reduce to a minimum the effect of major and minor errors  referred to in detail  m the last section  inherent to population statistics particularly  With this end in view it was decided to adopt a mathematical formula which  while producing a smooth progression of numbers from one quinquennial group to another  pr ovided also a law by which tlie number at each age could be in India   easih  obtained  10  The method of graduation adopted was with reference to a standard Table recommended by the late Air  Allred Henry in the discussion on a Paper submitted to the Institute of Actuaries by Mr  Ackland in connection with his 1911 Keport

coloured substantially by artificial increases due to inclusion of new areas and to progressive increase in the accuracy of the enumeration from  Census to Census  14  It will be seen that the real rate of increase has been the largest in the decennium 1921 1931 of all the periods  It may not be out of place at this stage to make some oliservations as to the desirability or otherwise of the very large rate of increase in the population which the decennium has witnessed  applied particularly to this country where the standard of living is proverbially low  Otherwise  the poignant v  ords of Francis Galton  inscribed in bold characters on the walls of the Biometric Laboratory of University College  London  by Gabon’s worthy aird famous disciple Prof  Karl Pearson and cjrroted at the beginrring of this topic  would be irrelevant  15  The rate of increase of the population has always remained a matter of absorbing iirteicst drriing the one hundred and thirty five years siirce Malthus in his Essay on  Prineiple of Population expressed real alarm at the rapid rate at which population was incrt asiirg and presented a very vivid and horrid picture of the He enunciated a law which in matheresults of indiscrhiiiuate multiplication  If the population of a confined area increases in matical larrguage can be stated thus geometrical progression  while the food prodrrction increases only in arr arithmetical progression  the former  nrrr st irrevitablv overtake and surpass the latter and within a short period there will be several people without any food  A few sentences may be quoted from Malthus Essay in illrrstration of his graphic description The population of the island  Great Britain  is computed to be about 7 millions and we    ’     will suppose the present produce equal to the support of such a number   In the first 25 years  the population would be 14 millions and the food being also doubled  the means of subsistence would be equal to the increase  In the next 25 years the population would be 28 millions and the means of subsistence only etpial to the support of 21 millions  In the next period the population would be 56 millions and the means of subsistence just sufficient for half that number  And at the conclusion of the first century the population would be 112 millions and the means  of subsistence just only equal to the support of 35 millions which would leave a 77 millions totally unprovided for ”  16   population of  ilalthiis has Ireen the subject of a certain amount of criticism on the score  He might have indulged of having depicted too horrid and too gi ue some a picture  in a little bit of cxaggei ation of which he should have been quite conscious  It should  however  be remenibered that he was practically the pioneer amongst the great thinkers of the woi ld who directed their attention to this great problem relating to population and its increase  Just as in the realm of Literatuie a Tragedy is consklered to incidcate a moral better than a Comedy  so also  in this case  Malthus having felt himself to be in the role of a teacher of the moral regarding population and its uncontrolled growth had to depict a shocking picture to impress on the imagination of the puljlic the consequences if the moral was disobeyed  He has also been criticised for making the starving millions breed and multiply in each period  The surplus population would not be straightaway wiped out but the immediate effect of population overtaking the means of subsistence would be a fall in the standard of living for the majority in the area which would give an impetus to indisciiiiiinate multiplication making the standard of living fall still lower thereby completing what is called the vieious eircle  of which India provides a good example  That birth rate is very highly and inversely correlated with status in the social scale  that is  with the standard of living  is illustrated by the following Table relating to England and Maries appearing in Mr  Carr Saunders  book on Population   TABLE XXIV  married men under 55 years of age Wales grouped and according to the occupation of the father  England tn  The number of

progression in which population is increasing   If Po be the population in the area under consideration at the commencement of an epoch and P  the population at time t measured from the beginning of

arithmetical progression of increase of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life is Kr  we shall  on the supposition that the available amount of the necessaries of life at the commencement of the epoch was just sufficient to support the population then existing in the area  viz   Po  obtain for the number of people which the resources of the area then available can support at the end of time t the quantity Po  1 j  Krt   If on Malthus’ assumption the population  increasing in geometrical progression  were to overtake the means of subsistence increasing in an arithmetical progression  though at a rate several times larger than the rate at which the population is increasing  we should have a value of t satisfying the equality PoC   Po  1   Krt      or l j     2^ ^  rt     ^  h The values of t given by the equation  A  give the period at the end of which population would overtake means of subsistence and there would subsequently result a shortage of food  One value of i is 0 corresponding to the commencement of the epoch  when the assumption was made that population had just sufficient for subAnother value of t  if one exists  would give the critical number of years sistence  at the end of which the food problem in the community would come to tell  PracOnly undeveloped countries like 03  tical values of r are never greater than Canada and New Zealand show anything near this rate  Even for Australia the value of r is about 02  For all practical values of r and practical values of K  the number of times food supply exceeds the needs of population  it is possible to find value of i by a process of successive approximation so well known to students of Actuarial Science  The values of t  the number of years at the end of which the population would overtake the food supply for practical values of r andK  have been These values have been calculated called “ Malthusian equivalent intervals ”  by Mr  G  H  Knibbs and are exhibited in the following Table     •  TABLE XXV  Malthusian equivalent intervals corresponding to various rates of increase  Number of times food supply exceeds needs of population   Number of years     before population

sufficient for supporting is just the present population  which is India in supply would food shortage the case   come to tell at the end of 126 years  being from far 18   2%  M22CC  l2  \f   AKNEXURE TO CHAPTER IV   l4 j   AGE   If food supply increases at  4% while population increases only at 1% the critical period will be reached at the end of 234 years  For 8 and 16 per cent  increases in food supply  population and food supply will attain equality at the end of 332 and 423 years respectively  These are small as compared with historical and geological periods   Thus the truth  of the  Malthusian proposition  is  established  bevond  doubt  19   The adage “ Population begets Population ” naturally points at a geometri   cal progression as the law governing the rate of increase of population   we proceed on this assumption  we are faced with incongruous results   If  however  Mr  Knibbs   several times referred to by me  has computed the average rate of increase of the population of the world weighted according to the population of each country  during the quinquennium 1906 1911 tobel 159 percent  per annum  The largest annual rate of increase of 2  98% was shown by Canada  Ireland was the only one of all the countries that indicated an annual rate of decrease of  006%  Amongst countries that showed an increase  France exhibited the lowest rate per annum being  016%  Referring to the average rate of increase of the population of the world of 1 159% per annum  Mr  Knibbs has some very interesting observations to make which I am quoting in extenso •     “ Either this rate of increase must  be enormously greater than has existed in the past history of the world or enormous numbers of human beings must have been blotted out by catastrophes of various kinds from  time to time  For  putting the present population  of the world  at 1 649 000 000 at the average rate of increase  this number would be produced from a single pair of  human beings in about 1  782 years  that is to say  since A  D  132 or since Salvius Julianusre ’ised under Hardian the Edicts of the Praetors  Even the rate given by the world populations 1804 and 1914  vr      0 0086  gives only 2 397 years  carrying us back to only B  C  483  or since the days of Darius I of Persia   The profound significance of this fact  accentuated also by the extraordinary increase in the length of life  expectation of life at age 0  which has revealed itself of recent years  is obvious  when the correlative food requirements are taken into account   The resources of Nature will have to be exploited in the future more successfully than in the past to maintain this rate of increasic  0 01159  which doubles the population every 60 15 years and would give for 10 000 years the colossal number 22 184 with 46 noughts  10‘   after it  “ This number is so colossal that it is  difficult to appreciate its magnitude  Assuming the earth to be a globe of 3 960 miles radius  of a density 5 527 compared with water  that water  weighs about 621 lbs  per cubic foot  and that a human being weighs on the average  say  100 lbs   7 st  2 lbs   the actual mass of the earth would  sons     that is  it would require 16 771  be equivalent only to say  132 265 X  lOi® perX 10^^ times as much “ matter ” as there is in the earth   Or  to consider it as a question of surface  allowing 1^ square feet per person  the  surface area would pro  ide standing room for only 36 625  X 10“ persons   That  earth’s entire  the popula10 ®^ times as great as there would be standing room if the whole earth’s surface were available  It is evident from this that the rate of increase of human beings must have been more approximate to the rate for France at the present time if the earth has been peopled for 10 000 years the French rate  0 0016  would require 12 842 years to give the present tion would be 60 570  is         population from a single pair   This rate  however  would give a population of only 17 55 mil   lions in 10 000 years   “ The foregoing analysis of the effect of the rate of increase  with which we are familiar  established the fact that the rate must have passed through great changes  and  could not have been maintained for any long period  either at its present average  or that characteristic of the last century  It is not improbable that the rate of the last quinquennium will not be long maintained and it is certain that however great human genius or effort may be  in enlarging the world’s food supplies  that rate cannot possibly be maintained for many centuries  The contention of Malthus is thus placed beyond question  from a different point of view  ”    20  From the above vivid description  it will be evident that the power of population just as the power of compound interest over a period measured in centuries is just as to shock the imagination  While solving problems in compound interest  how many of us did not regret the fact that a great great grandparent of ours of a couple of centmies back did not invest a few rupees at a small rate of interest  compounding annually   so as to amount to several lakhs for our present use  With increasing experience  however  we realize that in the realm of practical finance this is an absurdity  Similarly it is absurd to try to forecast the population in a given area  say  a thousand years hence  on the basis that the present rate of increase will continue to progress in a geometrical ratio  Correcting factors will  \fACTUARIAL REPORT   147  be at work to keep down the rate of growth  Malthus indulged purposely in some exaggeration when he omitted to paake mention of the correcting factors  21  If geometrical progression is to be ruled out  the question might naturally Quetelet’s brilliant be asked as to what the law underlying population growth is  analogy between the growth of population and the motion of a body through a resisting medium suggests a rational solution  In the case of such a body when the velocity is small  the force to impede the velocity is also small  As the velocity increases  the resistance also increases till the body cannot move in the medium at a velocity greater than a particular one  called the limiting velocity  whatever may be the magnitude of the force acting on the body making it move forward  Similarly  when the resources of a country and the amount of space available are large as compared to the population  very little impediment will be felt to the growth of population and it may actually increase at a rate approximating to the geometric progression  As density increases  and as the ratio of the undeveloped resources of the area to the population diminishes  the rate of growth will be arrested and will slowly diminish  attaining the value 0 when the population in the area will attain a stationary or constant value beyond which it cannot increase   •  22  To evolve a mathematical formrda for the law of population growth on the above analogy was  however  left first to Verhulst and then  quite independently of him  to Pearl and Reed  It is not necessary to give in detail here the mathematical processes by which the equation to the curve of population growth is obtained  The reader is referred to either “ Studies in Human Biology ” by R  Pearl or to the Presidential address dehvered by IVIr  G  Udny Yule before the Royal Statistical Society and appearing in Volume 88 of the Journal of that body   23  The rate per unit of time at which the population in a given area increases at any moment depends upon the absolute magnitude of the population in the area  at that moment subject to a retarding influence or  in mathematical language  a reducing factor depending on the diSerence between the maximum population which the area can support and the population at that moment  This leads to a differential equation for the  law  of population growth of the form 5        ^ l   f   which when solved leads to the equation  y where y is the population at any time t and L is the limiting value of the population which is approached when t becomes infinitely great  The form of the curve given by equation  B  representing a rational law of population growth is given by the accompanying diagram  y  \fANNEXUBE TO CHAPTEE IV   148     ^AGE   Time is measured along the X axis and the population along the Y axis  The axis part ABC of the curve of population growth ^s convex to the X aps  the year in any of time  showing that in this section the increase of population Up to the point C corresponding to time is larger than in the preceding year  to the density of population in the area is not very large and the impediment growth of population is not very intense  When the population already existing that in the area is s ma ll compared with the limiting population L  we can prove progrepion  the rate of increase in the population is very nearly in a geometrical   by making y For  in the di fferential equation to the curve  namely      ^or y ^A eH ^ very small as compared with L we obtain the simplified equation  which is the same as a logarithmic curve  or the curve of a geometrical progression  At the point C  the density of population in the area is one half the hmiting density and this is a point of inflexion at which the curve changes from conof vexity to concavity  Over the section CUE of the curve the increase on and goes preceding one population in any year is smaller than in the fUminishin g from year to year till the increase vanishes and the population attains a limiting value based on the area available for occupation and the capacity of the area to provide means of subsistence  That this curve for the law of population giowth very nearly fits in with the observed facts with respect to several countries has been proved by Messrs  Yule and Pearl in the Papers by these authors referred 24     to above      25 It appears  from the above analysis  it is reasonable to assume that in those countries such as for instance Canada  Australia  etc   where the available resources are not fully mobilized and the density is small as compared with the area nearly in fit for human habitation  population would continue to increase very conformity with the law “ Population begets Population ”  that is  in a geometrical That this rate of increase will in course of time be compelled to slow progression  down bv such methods as modern chdlization would tolerate and vanish when the population would attain its limiting value appears to be the only rational assump   tion   26 In those countries  where the level of education is high  this final or limitof the population will be reached by a voluntary and deliberate limitavalue ing birth rate which wiU bring as a natural reward a fall in the death rate the of tion thereby minimising misery  That most of the countries in Europe did substantially restrict the size of their families is proved with all the force of statistical analysis  The fall in the French birth rate is proverbial  In England the fall practically synchronised vfith the famous Bradlaugh Case   1877   which served to attract with an extraordinary fence public interest to a pamphlet giving information on birth control written by Dr  Knowlton of which Bradlaugh and Mrs  Besant were the publishers  The Germans were rather late in taking interest in the subject  But when once they did they were systematic and thorough and flooded their countrv with literature on the subject  The fall in the German birth rate in the years just before the Great War was phenomenal     27 In other countries  of which India is a good example  where due to lack of imagination which education inculcates and the consequent laissez faire attitude of the people towards matters of vital importance  actions are not intelligently directed towards safeguarding the happiness of the future  but by adopting a policy “ with every mouth God sends a pair of hands” of drift pinning faith on the proverb the limiting population will be reached by a high birth rate bringing in its trail a high death rate and the inevitable physical and mental suffering which a high death rate would naturally entail  The following Table comparing England and Wales and India over a quinquennium shows that in England and Wales where the birth rate is low  due to a larger fall in death rate  the survival rate is really larger than in India wtie  e the effect of a larger birth rate is neutralized by a heavy    death rate

soar high will have to pay large penalties in the shape of heavy death rates  for Xature is a relentless task mistress and will always have her own way  30  One can judge whether or not a country is suffering from the effects of over population by the standard of living obtaining in the countay as economists M22CC  \f      ANNEXURE TO CHAPTER IV   150   AGE   hold that low standard of living is a sure index of over population  When the number of mouths is considerably larger than the capacity of the soil to provide food for them  the standard of living should naturally fall  Let me quote from what Carr Saunders says in this connection with particular reference to India and China  “ Infanticide was employed in India and China until recently it has now been abandoned and no other method of keeping the size of the families small has taken its place  An examination of the social conditions suggests that the people are not living as well as they might famines are not uncommon and are never far off  The symptoms point to over population  of which the       cause would seem to be the failme to replace the custom of infanticide by some other method of regulation ” 31  No greater proof is requued of the fact that what primarily ails India is over population than the low  miserably low  standard of living of the masses  This would indicate that the actual position of the Indian population in the Logistic curve of population growth given in page 147 is in the section CDE of the curve  possibly very near E round about which point  if Nature’s Law is to be obeyed  any fmther increase in the population should be practically nil  In other words  there should be  very nearly  only as many babies born as there is wastage due to deaths  To subject the soil to increased pressure due to the addition of nearly 34 millions in a decade when the standard of living is proverbially low is a situation that should cause real alarm in the minds of well wishers of India  Without an addition in real wealth of  at least  the same extent  of which there has been no very large indication  the existing low standard of living is sure to be depressed further  leading  as has already been indicated  to further over population and consequent increase in the loss F or  successive generations of life on less than bare margin of the spirit of enterprise  al indolence and despondency which such a state natui the and of subsistence any majority of Indians abstain making probably made the from have engenders first standard living  which could their of be achieved in the

difference between the I ates of mortality and the expectations of life relating ro male^ between the experience of the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company embracing the period of two

rates of mortality of the latter are more than 100 per cent  heavier India  in age of life than those of the former  The low economic status of middle to the up the masses in India is firstly the direct cause of heavier mortality through undernourishment and secondly it helps to maintain mortality at a very high level by depressing the standard of living which brings about a very large increase both in  buth and death rates   The remedy  in short  lies in Birth Control among families of poor economic In the Census Eeport for Mysore State  just to hand  one is pleased to find “ By an

modifications to the  Makeham formula  Firstly instead of log l^  This appears to have been adopted mainlv for the facility the Lform gave to obtain the values of L   the population at each  age  at

operations and even if they are  the sacrifice of the conveniences derived from this principle at the very young ages is not of any consequence  The second modification made by Sir George was the addition of the term to provide for the higher mortality  and the consequent faster decrement of the numbers surviving to each age at the infantile ages and ages of childhood as compared with the adult ages  This term has its maximum value at age 0 and diminishes rapidly as age increases  38  The rate of mortality at age 0  qo  of Burma males was first obtained as follow From the graduated

194 and called A  B  C  etc   toV      Explanation of the Columns of the Mortality Table  42  It is usual to say a few words at this stage explaining the fundamental columns of the mortality Table  The column  headed “ Living at age x ”  usually denoted by the symbol l^  represents the number of persons alive at the beginning of each age interval out of 100 000 persons born alive  The words born alive ” are used with the view to call attention to the fact that still births are excluded and the column refc s only to survivors of living births  It should also be particularly noted that the moaning of the heading Living at age x” is living at the begimiing of the age interval x to x   l  that is  at the precise moment of completing It mav also be added that the 100 000 the integral number of years of age x  persons under observation fjom birth are not assumed as having Ijeen born at the same moment  The main point to be st^ essed is that the flow of lives from age to age in this column is based on the assumption that every one of the 100 000 births is kept under obsei vation from the moment of birth and a regular record is maintained as to how many are alive at exact age one year  how manv at exact age two years  and so on to the end of life  The total number counted as alive at exact age one year is entered opposite to age 1 in this column and so on for other ages  This is the fundamental column of the mortalitv Table and shows the decrement of life fi om age to age throughout the whole range of life  Taking   for example  Table A  relating to All India Males  we see that out of  100 000 chib  \f153  ACTUARIAL REPORT   dren born alive only 52 439 attain age 18  the age of majority in India  The oriThe proverbial “ threeginal number is reduced to one half at about age 21f  ” out of every attained only 100 000 born  by 7 036 is score and ten years ” shows the 43  The next column 3 headed “ Dying between ages x and a  l l number dying after attaining the age shown in colunm 1 but before attaining the  next higher age out of 100 000 persons born alive  It is merely the decrement of the numbers in column 2 and is obtained by taking the difference between sucThe number of deaths  very high for the age cessive numbers in that column  interval 0 to 1  diminishes rapidly till about age 10  11 or 12  there being minor variation from Province to Province  which is the most favourable period in hfe  From this point onwards the number of deaths increases till it attains a maximum more or less in the neighbourhood of age 40 for males and then slowly tails ofi to In countries where the rates of mortality till about middle age are not so zero  heavy as in India this maximum appears much later in life  that is  after age 70  Since this column indicates the number of deaths occurring in each age interval amongst a diminishing number of persons alive at the beginning of that age interval  it cannot give an adequate idea of the rate of mortality at each age  This is however given by the next column  44  The next column headed “ Mortality per cent ” shows the number dying age interval among 100 alive at the beginning of the interval  Just as in each in the case of the preceding column relating to the number dying between the ages X and x     the mortality per cent  which is very large for age 0 rapidly diminishes to age 11 or 12  From this point onwards it increases slowly at first and more rapidly from and after age 50 and towards the end of the Table the rate of increase is extremely rapid   Living between ages x and x   l Column 5 with the heading be particularly distinguished from column 2 headed “ Living at age x 45   ”  has to  It might  be of interest here to mention that the Life Table or mortality Table under explanation shows the number of persons surviving to each year of age and the number of persons dying between two consecutive integral ages in a stationary population undisturbed by migration and where only as many are born as die during the year in all the age periods  In other words  in the construction of the mortality Table  disturbances due to migration and irregular flow of births and deaths from year to year over the period considered are eliminated and rates of mortality obtained as applicable to the population when freed from these disturbing This column shows the number of persons that would have been influences  enumerated at each age last birthday in a stationary population supported by 100 000 births had a Census been taken at any moment during the year  In other words  the total number opposite to age 25  say  is the population between ages 25 and 26 at all fractional ages between these two integral ones  46  The number in column 6 recorded opposite to any age shows the total population that would have been returned as of that age and all older ages to the end of the Table at a Census taken at any time  It is obtained by adding the population in the preceding colunm from the current age to the end of the Table  The number in this column opposite to age 0 represents the total population maintained by 100 000 births per annum in a community subject to the rates of mortality given in column 4  This column is of particular interest in so far as it enables two countries or two communities subject to different rates of mortality to be compared as regards their age distribution  Due to the heavy rates of mortality to which Indian population is subject  we find on reference  for instance  to the AU India Male Table A that about half the population is under age 24 and the other half aged 24 and above and only about a quarter of the population lives aged 40 and above  whereas  in countries subject to lighter rates of mortality these proportions occur at ages substantially later  For instance  in the United States of America  1910 experience  half the population is over 31 years of age and about one fourth over age 50  The corresponding ages for England and Wales  1911 The numbers appearing in this column can also be experience  are 33 and 51  interpreted in another way  The number appearing  for instance  opposite to age 25 not only represents  as explained above  the total population aged 25 and upwards but also the total number of years of future life time that would be lived by those alive at the beginning of age 25 given in column 2  namely  47 787   \fANlfEXUEE TO CHAPTER IV   154     ^AGE   The next and the last column headed “ Mean after life time at age x ” expectation of life Being  as is more or less is also commonly known as the explained by the heading itself  the mean or average futiu’e life time lived by all persons attaining a particular age x  the number in this column opposite to any 47   age  on the basis of the explanation given towards the end of the last paragraph  is obtained by dividing the number in column 6 by the number in column 2 appearThis expression ” expectation of life   is associated uig opposite to the same age   in public minds with not a little confusion due to the unfortunate choice of the word ” expectation   which has however come to stay  It is much better to call mean after life time ’’ or   average after life time People usually consider it  the expectation of life at any age to represent the number of years any individual ” still to live  of that age may ” reasonably expect This is  however  not the case  Given a large number of individuals  say  aged 30 not chosen by any selective process  we shall find persons in all states of health  The expectation of life at age 30 means only the average life time lived by all persons of that age in the fuiure  some livirrg very lorrg arrd others having orrly a short span of life  In the process of averaging we take the excess from those who live long and distribute it amorrg those who die early  so as to place all on an equality  As applied  therefore  to any particular individual  the expectation of life has no significance whatsoever  If he is irr a very bad state of health his future life time may be far shorter and if he be in sound health it may be far longer than the expectation of life  The chief importance of this function lies in the fact that it affords a ready mearrs of comparing two mortality Tables for the cumulative effect of mortality at all ages above any particular age   Comparisons  48  It will be essential before concluding the Report to compare the results arrived at by my investigations with the earlier ones  Before  however  this is done  it is necessary to stress that a few important points should be borne in mind  The essential difierence between my investigation and those of my predecessors is traceable to the fact that  whereas I included in each area the British Province and the adjoining Feudatory Indian States  their investigations were confined to British Provinces only  A certain amount  therefore  of the difference between the rates of mortality as deduced by me and by my predecessors with respect to each Provincial group can  naturally  be traced to the variations in the areas dealt with  In the absence of mortality Tables constructed separately relating to the larger Indian States  it will not be possible to say how far their inclusion has tended either to increase or diminish the aggregate mortality of the respective British Province with which each of them has been grouped  It was  however  felt that the vitality of the Indian Empire should be appraised in suitable geographical groups without omitting any area and on the Census Commissioner expressing his opinion in favour of this procedure  I agreed very gladly to conduct my investigations on these lines as I was also very strongly in favour of adopting this course  49  Another point to bear in mind  when comparing the mortality of the same Province in two different Censuses  is the fact that the rates of mortahty may appear as having improved  whereas they may have deteriorated  due to improved efficiency in methods of Census enumeration showing artificially a very large increase  In illusfration of this point I have only to refer to Tables XXIX and showing the rates of mortality and Tables XXXI and XXXII showing expectations  of life for rcales and females respectively in the Provincial group  Central Provinces and Hyderabad  By referring to either of these Tables  it will be evident that the mortality in this area is considerably superior in 1931 as compared with what it was The Hyderabad State has returned at the 1931 Census a total population in 1881  is nearly which 15 % in excess of the population returned at the 1921 Census  W hereas the rate of increase for the wEole of India is only about lOj per cent  The very large increase in the population  shown by the Hyderabad State at the 1931 Census  has been attributed by the Census Commissioner to increased efficiency of the Census staff and there can be no other comdncing explanation  Since the rates of mortahty depend on the rates of increase  the very large increase in population shown by the Hyderabad State should have lightened significantly the mortality rates relating to the Central Provinces  Berar and Hyderabad group  A substantial part  therefore  of the improvement in vitality shown by the Central Provinces between 1881 and 193  might be traced to this cause   XXX  \f155  ACTUAEIAL REPORT   50  There is yet a third point to be borne in mind consequent upon the deduced rates of mortality being to a certain extent sensitive to the methods of graduation adopted both with respect to the population and the rates of increase  With respect to the latter  whether a constant rate of increase at all ages or a variable one from age to age has been adopted  after graduation  also affects the results to a certain extent Where  however  the collected statistics are subject only to minor errors due to the paucity of the data  difierent methods of graduation will have very little effect upon the deduced rates of mortality  With respect to the Indian Census Returns  where the errors are of very large magnitude  smoothing formulas of very great power have to be adopted with the result  above mentioned  that the calculated rates of mortality depend to a significant extent upon the smoothing formula or the formula of graduation  This is particularly so at the ages of infancy and childhood where  even in countries which place a substantial reliance on the statistics at the other ages  help has to be derived from the records of births and deaths to correct irregularities relating to them  We are without any guide whatsoever in India with respect to the flow of vital occurrences at the very young ages  The only small material on hand is nearly half a century old and therefore quite obsolete for our present purpose  It also refers only to a limited area which  as compared to the size of the Indian Subcontinent  is entirely unrepresentative of parts distant from itself  All these factors have to be borne in mind before comparisons are effected between either the results of one Province from one Census to another or of one Province with another in the same Census  If  therefore  in effecting comparison on the above lines the differences traced are only very small  it wall be unsafe to attach any large significance to them  51  The task of comparing the results brought out by me with those of mv predecessors appears a huge one as I have constructed as many as twenty two Tables for both the sexes after dividing India and Burma into ten large geographical areas  The mortality Tables corresponding to three of these areas  namely  Bihar and Orissa Eajputana  Ajmere Merwara and the Central India States and Agency group Sind  Baluchistan and N  W  F  Province  have been constructed by me for the first time  With respect to these areas  therefore  in the absence of mortality Tables relating to the earlier Censuses  it will not be possible to say in what direction variation in mortality lay  As regards the other Provinces  I propose to draw conclusions relating to the trend of mortalitv on broad and general lines only        52  The obvious way of comparing two Tables of mortality either with respect to the same locality at different epochs or of two different localities or communities  at the same epoch is to compare the rates of mortality  that is  the numbers appearing in the column headed “ Mortality per cent ” in the Life Tables to V  Though this method provides an effective way of comparing the trend of mortality at individual ages without the comparison being vitiated by variations at all other ages between the Tables compared  it suffers from the disadvantage of beim^ too laborious as every age has to be compared individually  AMiere  therefore  ^it is considered desirable to eliminate minor fluctuations at individual ac es Tables could be compared in large groups of quinquennial or decennial age periods by computing what is called the probability of dying over 5 or 10 year age periods  and Tables give for each sex the rates of mortality at all quinquennial  A  XXIX  XXX  age points  0  5  10  etc   in each Province from the 1881 to 1931 Censuses vvherever these are av^ailable  Though a general tendency may be discerned in the case of some Provinces for the rates of mortality at the adult and older ages to diminish  this is  however  subject to such large fluctuations as to make anv statement to this effect dev^oid of its emphasis  Burma  howev^er  shows itself to hav^e slightlv  A  deteriorated even at these ages  substantial improvement in the rates of mortality at the very young ages is  however  apparent in each Province  It would have been unsafe to place too much reliance on the lighter mortality  exhibited at the young ages as a result of the pre sent analysis  due to the great unreliability of the data relating to these ages but for the fact that the available statistics of deaths pertaining to these ages have gone to confirm this inference  These statistics of deaths are  of course  not dependable but they are no more so now than formerly and  on the supposition that the amount of error has remained constant  there is room for drawing the conclusion that the mortality at the very young ages  notably in the first year after birth  has improved to a certain extent  It vvould  \fANKEXUEE TO CHAPTER IV   156 therefore      ^AGE   appear that the seferal Baby Week Exhibitions and other propaganda  relating to the proper bringing up of children carried on frequently during the last decade have come to bear some fruit  The Nation  therefore  should feel grateful  to the organisers of these exh ibitions  53   Another point of great importance which must cause concern to workers  in the cause of public welfare  especially in connection with minimising the perils attendant on maternity revealed not only by the 1931 Actuarial Analysis but also  by the earlier ones  is the heavder mortality of females as compared with males pracfrom about age 12 to about age 45  In the other sections of the Table  female mortality is lighter than that of males  It will be of interest in this connection to refer to the rates of mortality of both the sexes with respect to England and AVales given in Tables XXIX and XXX  It will be observed that in England female mortality is  in the major part of the Table  substantially lighter than male mortality and between ages 10 and 15 where female mortality rises relatively to male mortality it only approaches the latter without exceeding it  A reference to the Life Tables relating to other countries notably the United States of America also indicates that female mortality is throughout lighter than male mortality  The heavier mortality of females as compared with that of males from about the age of adolescence to the age when capacity for child bearing may be expected to cease appears to be a feature of the mortalit ^ experience of Indian females  A considerable part of the heavy mortality of girls in their teens can naturally be traced to immature maternity if correct statistics are maintained according to age and cause of death  That noble piece of Legislation called by the name “ Sarda Act ” has not been sufficiently long on the Statute Book for its effects The salutary restriction to make themselves evident in the decennium considered  imposed by this Act against the marriage of immature boys and girls combined with increasing knowledge on matters relating to maternity and to pre natal and post natal ailments  will  it is hoped  make considerable part of the excess mortality of females at the reproductive ages diminish   tically  54  Another method of comparing mortality Tables that has been very largely adopted in the past is to compare what has been called “ the mean after life time ” which is also commonly known as “ the expectation of life” the method of calculation of which from the fundamental column  showing the number of survivors from age to age  of a mortality Table was explained in an earlier paragraph  The chief advantage of this quantity lies in the fact that by its use one is able to compare mortality Tables for the cumulative efiect of mortality over its entire length from any given age  For instance  comparing two mortality Tables by their expectations of life  say  at age 25  one would be able to judge which of the two Tables shows in the aggregate lighter mortality from age 25 up to the end of the mortality Table  This method of comparison by expectation of life has  therefore  the advantage of not giving prominence to minor fluctuations in mortality rates at particular ages  Where  however  it is desired to compare mortality Tables over short ranges  the function called temporary expectation of Tables XXXI and XXXII give the expectations of life can be made use of  life for all the Provincial groups from 1881 to 1931 for males and females separately  By comparing the expectation of life at age 0 for two Provinces or for two difiereut Censuses of the same Province  one is able to compare the mortahty rates to which the populations of the two Provinces are subject in the former case and the variation in the mortality of the Province from one Census to another in the latter  It need hardly be mentioned that the larger the expectation of hfe the Lighter is the mortaIt will be seen that the expectation of life at age 0 shows a substantial imlity  provement at the 1931 Census over the other four Censuses brought in the comparison excluding that of 1921 with respect to which no expectation of life was calculated  Since the rates of mortality relating to the very young ages in India are not entirely dependable  one would rather be inclined to draw conclusions by eliminating these ages  that is  by comparing the expectation of life at age 5 or preferably age 10  55  I shall make a few observations relating to the trend of mortahty in each Province by comparing the expectations of life at age 10  These observations It will however be easy for any one will be mostly confined to the male Tables  to draw his own conclusions from the experience of female lives from a study of Table XXXII on more or less identical lines  The mortality in the Province of  \fACTUABIAL REPORT   157  Bengal does not show any decided tendency to improve substantially  Though the expectation of life at age 10 in 1931 is somewhat larger than in 1901 and in 1911  it is to a certain extent smaller than in 1891 and substantially so as compared with 1881 Bihar and Orissa  which have been dealt with separately in one group for the first time after the 1931 Census  exhibit expectations of life up to age 50 markedly supeBombay and IMadras have rior to those of the adjoining Province of Bengal  substantiallyimproved as compared with 1881 but it will be remembered that they had to bear the brunt of the 1870 78 famine which accounted for the very heavy mortality and the consequent low expectations of life of these two Provinces 1881  The expectations of life at age 10 in these two Provinces in 1931 are smaller than in 1891  the decade 1881 1891 having been one of comparative prosperity for them  Bombay shows substantial improvement in 1931 as compared with 1901 and 1911  As regards the main cau se of the low expectation of life shown by Bombay in 1901 it  should be observed that this Province along with Central Provinces was affected by the 1899 1901 famine though Madras was unafiected by it  The expectation of life at age 10 for the province of Madras has been keeping more or less steady from 1911 onwards  Burma has always been noted for its lighter mortality as compared with other Indian Provinces in the pa st which reputation it yet maintains though the expectation of life of this Province does not indicate anv decided tendency to increase but is keeping more or less steady  The first Life Table with respect to the Central Provinces was constructed after the 1881 Census and the second one after the 1931 Census  The latter  however  includes the experience of the very large population contained in H  E  H  The Nizam’s Dominions  It will   e seen that the Central Provinces show  substantial improvement in mortality in 1931 as compared with 1881  As has already been observed  a large portion of this improvement should naturally be tiaced to the improved machinery of Census taking set up by the Hyderabad State at the 1931 Census  The Punjab group  comprising the British Provinces of the Punjab and the adjoining smaller Indian States together with Kashmir  the bigge st in area of all the Indian States  shows in 1931 an improvement in mortality which is decidedly substantial  In 1911  however  this Province  «howed the heaviest morThe imtalit   of all the Indian Provinces except perhaps the United Provinces  provement noticed in 1931 ha s been such as to bring tlie position practically back to the 1891 level when the experience of the Province as to mortalit   was the It is higlily probable that a pait of lighte st of all the decennial investigations  the improv ement has been due to combining the Punjab with Kashmir noted for It is  liowever  not possible to make its highly salubrious and temperate climate  any definite statement to this effect before proving by Actuarial analysis that the people in Kashmir are subject to lighter mortality than those in the Punjab as other factors may be at v ork  for instance  low economic status  neutralising the Rajputana and Ajmere IMerwara as also hiind  efiect of the salubrious climate  Baluchistan and North West Frontier Province are two Provincial groups with respect to which mortality Tables have been constructed for the finst time at the 1931 Census  The former group has indicated the heaviest mortality for males The United Provinces show some improveof all Provincial groups dealt with  ment in mortality in 1931 though it is not very substantial as indicated by the small increase averaging about a year as compared with 1891 in the expectation of life up to about age 40  The improvement in mortality for the male population of the whole of India in 1931 is indicated by the value of the expectation of life at age 10 which is very nearly one year in excess of the highest value of this function which was reached in 1891  Generally speaking  it can be said that the influence of the hygienic and economic factors that prevailed in the decennium 1921 1931 was such as to bring the condition of the Indian population as to its mortality experience nearly back to the 1891 position   m  56  Amongst all the Provincial groups analysed  Burma shows the lightest mortality  As a matter of fact  it has been keeping up the first rank in this respect in all the three Censuses analysed with respect to this Province  Madras which used to keep always the second rank appears to have lost a little bit of ground  as the Punjab  judged by the value of the expectation of life at age 10  has superseded Whether the grouping of the British Province of Madras with the it in 1931  adjoining Indian States has proved a disadvantage to it and the grouping of the Punjab with Kashmir has proved an advantage to the Punjab group is a matter  \fAXJvEXURE TO CHAPTER IV   158     ^AGE   which requires further detailed analysis  It is  ho’wever  somewhat significant that the two Provinces  Burma and Madras  which have beeir indicating substantially lighter mortality than that of the other Indian Provinces  haA e been the least inaccurate in returning ages  Bihar and Orissa for which a Life Table has been constructed for the first time in conirection with the 1931 Census indicate mortality at all ages up to 50 substantially lighter than the adjoiniirg Provincial group  Bengal  and Assam  which exhibits the worst vitality of all the Provinces except perhaps Raiputarra aird Aimere Meiwara group  The difiereirce between the vitalities of these two Provincial groups is rrot  ho^vever  very substantial  57   The comparative statemeirts detailed above have been made with special  reference to the expectations of life relatiirg to male lives of the various Provincial groups and for All Lidia appeariirg iir Table XXXI  The corresponding expecta   XXXII  Here again Burma As betweeir Madras and the Punjab fenrales  the former show lighter mortality at all young ages up to 30 and after this age the position is reversed  The heaviest mortality amongst females is shown by the This is very probably Sind  Baluchistan and XorthAVe st Frontier Proviirce group  due to the strict purdah observed by the females in this group of which the populations of life relating to females are given in Table feiiiales show the lightest mortality   ’     tion is predominantly Muhamn adarr  Vitality  ouR superior to that of the Provincial group just considered but inferior to the rest of India  is shown by Bengal  and Assam  and Eajputaua and Ajmere Merwara groups  The former shows heavier moitality than the latter upto about age 40 after which the position is reversed  Taking female mortality as a whole it can be stated that the deterioration which set in from 1901 onwards has not yet taken a definite turn towards improvement  Whereas in the case of males the position in 1931 with respect to vitality was such as to bring it back very nearly up to the high level reached in 1891  the female vitality  however  does not indicate any recovery of the lost ground  58  So far I have compared either the same Province at difierent Censuses or one Province with another at the same Census  It will  however  be interesting to compare Indian mortality with that of the other countries of the world  It has often been said that the Indian population exhibits the worst vitality of all the countries of the world which have analysed their mortality experience but  except perhaps for Tables comparing India with England  no statistics ha  e been published so far to indicate the force of the statement that India exhibits the heaviest mortality of all civilised countries  Believing in the truism that figures speak more forcibly than words  I have taken advantage of the publication in Prof  Glover’s admirable volume   ‘United States Life Tables 1890 1910 ’ of the mortality Tables relating to no less than thirteen representative countries of the world including India  These are exhibited in the six Tables from XXXIII to XXXVIII three of which relate to males and the other three to females  Prof  Glover has given in his volume extensive figures for all the functions of the mortality Tables and for each age to which none  interested in studying the comparative mortality of the countries of the wurld  can help referring  I have  however  chosen only three of these mortality functions and have also further condensed my Tables by gi ving values only at quinquennial ages  Tables XXXIII and XXXIV give for males and females re spectively the number of persons that die in a year out of 1 000 observed at each quinquennial age  The very hea  y rate of mortality experienced by the Indian population as compared with all the other twelve countries will be evident  It will also be observed that the ratio of the mortality in India to the mortality of the other countries is very large at the younger ages and at some age points the mortality in India is more than nearly seven times as heavy as that of countries which exhibit light mortality  As age advances there is a tendency for the ratio to diminish yet the Indian mortality keeps substantially hea^vier than that of the other countries  Tables and XXXYI  showing for the two sexes how rapidly the numbers survmng to each quinquennial age out of 100 000 children born dimini sh^ might be considered as affording a better basis for comparative study by some people  It will be seen that  in India  before age 5 is reached nearly 45 000 young lives out of 100 000 children born are lost  whereas even the country that exhibits the lowest survivorship amongst the other twelve brought into the comparison shows a wastage of only about 27 000 and Norway noted for its very light mortality loses only something less than 12 000 in the first 5 ages  Survivors to age 10 are only about half the number of children born in India and the very large number surviving        XXXV  \fACTUARIAL REPORT   159  to this age in other countries will he evident from a study of the Tables  The two Tables afford a ready means of making such comparisons at all quinquennial ages and the appallingly heavy toll claimed by death in India will be evident even from a cursory scrutiny of them  Tables XXXATII and XXXVIII give the values of the expectations of life for all the countries and the small values  as compared with other countries  of this function relating to India as a sure indication of the very heavy mortality experienced by it will be evident   59 In bringing this Eeport to a close  I have to draw the special attention of the authorities in charge of the registration of the vital occurrences in India to the extreme desirability  nay necessity  of focussing particular attention on a limited area    in each Province with the view to obtain complete statistics of births and deaths in the locality  the latter either according to individual ages or quinquennial age periods grouped in the same manner as recommended by me for the 1941 Census enumeration  As many as six Actuarial analyses undertaken in connection with Indian Censuses have been performed by methods more or less in the nature of makeshifts and it will be extremely desirable to make the seventh and subsequent ones  at least  follow the normal and  therefore  comparatively more easy method of mortality Table construction  I know it will be practically impossible to expect the records of vital statistics with respect to the entire area in each Province in India to come up to the requisite degree of accuiacy within a decade  That is v hy I am recommending a representative small area in each Province being subject to special scrutiny so that it may provide  by the time of the next Census  dependable records of vital occurrences  The relatively groat accuracy of the records of vital statistics in the Presidency of Madras have been commented upon earlier in this Eeport  If this accuracy is maintained and further improved ujDon  we shall have by 1941 sufficient material on hand with respect to one very large Province supplying a long • felt want     60 Just when this Eeport is nearing completion  practically at the very moment I am writing these lines  I have received from the Census Commis sioner a    Table showing the deaths in the Presidency of Madras that occurred during the ten calendar years  1921 to 1930 both inclusive  It will  therefore  not be possible for me to make any investigations making use of the statistics of deaths  in such time as to enable the results to be incorporated in this Eeport  This will  however  be done in a Paper I propose to submit to the Institute of Actuaries  London  The infantile deaths  i e   deaths below age one  are divided in this Table into four useful “ over one week  a id under one month ”  categories as follows “ under one week “ over one month but not exceeding six months ” and “ over six months but not exceeding twelve months ”  MTth respect to higher ages  however  up to age 20 one finds the orthodox quinquennial groupings 1 4 10 14 5 9 and 15 19 ’  From age 20 onwards the groupings are decennial with one large group at the end of 60 and over  The groups could preferably be modified to be in conformity with those to be adopted in collecting population statistics at the 1941 Census  It will be essential  if the Life Tables to be constructed after the 1941 Census are to include the Indian States in the same way as the Life Tables constructed now do  that the Indian States should also make efforts to supply reliable statistics of vital occurrences in the inter censal period between now and the date of the next Census  If this is not done and if reliable records of births and deaths are only available for British Provinces there will be no other alternative but to revert to the old method of constructing Life Tables only with reference to the British Provinces in India        ‘        ‘  ‘     ‘     ’     61 The situation takes a different aspect altogether when we come to consider the ages of infancy and childhood  Here vfithout exaggeration we are simply    groping in the dark and it has only been repeated too often by my predecessors and myself that the Proclaimed Clans experience of nearly half a century ago as giving any basis to deduce mortahty rates at the very young ages applicable to the present generation of children  If the recommendations inade in the previous paragraph are given effect to from now there would be suffiis entirely useless  cient statistics on    hand by about the next Census date which would provide  Actuary to deduce mortality rates not only at the ages of infancy and childhood but also at the older ages  If  however  it is found not possible just yet to give immediate effect to them in their entirety  steps should be taken to maintain accurate records of births and deaths up to M22CC „ reliable basis to the investigating  \fAKNEXURE TO CHAPTER IV   160     ^AGE   age 15 at least in representative small areas in each  Province  This wiU provide the Actuary at the next Census with sufficient material to deduce reliable rate Recommendations to this effect were made of mortality at the very young ages  Census  repeated by Mr  Ackland after 1911 Sir Hardy after the 1901 George by Census and emphasised by Mr  Meikle after the 1921 Census  but  one has to state with regret  to no purpose  IVIr  Ackland said in this connection   The record and investigation of these statistics  Proclaimed Clans statistics  apparently ceased Hardy’s 1901 in 1904 and  as explained earlier in the present Report and in Report  the data furnished between 1891 and 1904 were so limited as to age as to be It is clear that results based on practically useless for the purposes desired  statistics referring to the period 1876 1890  could not properly be employed in any future investigation of Census Returns and it is therefore most desirable  and indeed essential  if complete Life Tables are to be deduced in futirre  that some effort should be made to secure trustworthy data as to the births in the several Ackland’s Provinces  and the deaths at the ages of infancy and childhood ”  words expressed in the above terms twenty years ago  will hold even more emphaIt is  therefore  earnestly tically by the time the next Census falls to be taken  hoped that the Government of each Province will take the necessary steps to give    effect to the  recommendations in this respect at least  Achioivledgments   62  It is now  my pleasant duty to acknowledge help from various persons which  I received not only in the preparation of this Report but also in making the very  elaborate calculations which the construction of the twenty  two Life Tables had involved  of which only those that have had any experience in conducting statisI tical investigations in all their various details would have an adequate idea  had naturally to be in constant correspondence with Dr  Hutton  the Census Commissioner for India  and his replies to my various enquiries were prompt  fidl and marked by an extreme measure of courtesy which is gratefully acknowledged  I found his intimate knowledge of the conditions obtaining in the different parts of India and of Indian sociology of particular help in forming my Provincial grou  s  I have to express my indebtedness to my friend and colleague in the Oriental Life Office    Ir  Douglas Forrest  F F A   who read the Report in manuscript and gave suggestions of a usefid character  As regards the help I received to complete the laborious work in connection with the preparation of the Life Tables I have been particularly fortunate  for  what I received was not help of a purely clerical nature  but help from young men aspiring for Actuarial honours and therefore imbued with the desire to learn the work  It was a pleasure to see these young men from day to day ever ready to take up with a cheerful countenance the large quantity of laborious work they were called upon to do  To one and all of them I express my gratitude and do hope that the training they received will stand them in good stead  when in the fullness of time some of them at least may be called upon sincere thanks are also due to undertake investigations of a similar nature  to Mr  Minocher J  S  Kliras  F S S   a friend and colleague of mine whose very long association with the Royal Statistical Society extending over a period of more than a quarter of a century was particularly helpful in placing at my disposal the vast store of Statistical knowledge carefully preserved in the pages of the Jom nals of that body to which and to the pages of the Journals of the Institute that storehouse of knowledge on Actuarial matters I had constantof Actuaries ly

of the Returns   78  The figiires of the population of India by sexes show a further continuation of the steady fall in the proportion of females to males that has been going on since 1901  V arious reasons have frequently been repeated to explain this shortage of females which is so characteristic of the population of India as compared to  VEARS  YEARS  that of most European countries  The female infant is definitely better equipped by nature for survival than the male  but in India the advantage she has at birth is probably neutrahsed in infancy by comparative neglect and in adolescence by the strain of bearing children too early and too often  Sons are everywhere desired not only among Hindus  where a son is necessary to his father’s salvation  but almost equally so among other coramimities as well daughters in many parts of India mean great pecimiary expense in providing for their marriage  which moreover  among the majority perhaps of Hindus  must be arranged by the time thej^ reach puberty  So strong indeed is the prejudice against the birth of daughters that abortion is reported to be sometimes practised if the child in the womb is foretold to be a girl  In every province in India the available Yutal statistics indicate that fewer females are bom than males  It is admitted that the Yutal statistics are incomplete and that there is a definite tendency to omit to report the birth of females in a greater degree than that of the similar omission with regard to males at the same time the inequality which can be attributed to this source is not enough to balance the excess of male births reported   nor is there any evidence to justify an assumption of widespread female infanticide  though that practice no doubt lingers in isolated or remote areas  since as lately as 1930 the Jammu and Kashmir State Government had to take special measures to suppress it in certain Eajput villages  while the extraordinarily low female ratio of the Shekhawat branch of the Kachwaha clan of Eajputs in Jaipur State  530 females per 1  000 males  is indubitably suggestive of deliberate interference with the natural ratio  when considered with the Eajput tradition  The next worst Eajput ratios are those of the Bhadauria and Tonwar Eajputs in Gwalior State which are 634 and 622 females per 1  000 males respectively and these are also so low as to appear extremely       M22 X   195  Sex Ratie   \f   CHAPTER  196  V    SEX   suspicious of the same thing  being very much lower than the ratio  754  for the Hindu Rajputs of Jammu and Kashmir  Comparative neglect of female children is however admittedly common and taking the population as a whole the superior vitalitv of the female is unable to become operative at all until she reaches the age  Further  among Hindus and Jains the effect of the consequent limitation in the number of females as compared to males is accentuated by a ban on  of 20 years   widow re marriage  In regard to the female ratio of the Kachwaha Rajputs  it is necessary to quote the Census Superintendent of Rajputana    “ In considering these figures one is at once struck by the very lovr female ratio   584 females  per 1  000 males  among Kachwahas  It is this that brings the ratio for all Rajputs as low as 796  If they are excluded the ratio is 841 which approximates to those for the closely akin IndoAryan races such as Jats  Gujars and Ahirs  The reason for the paucity of females must therefore be sought for among conditions that are peculiar to rhe Kachwahas   This large  important  and numerous clan acknowledges as its head the Ruler of  Jaipur  a State the geographical posi” Pfichcham I a beta aitr Piteab ki heti” tion of which renders the Rajput m atrimonial adage of A bridegroom from the West can only suitably be sought from the difficult of fulfilment  Rathor of Bikaner and 5Iarwar among whom the laws of hypergamy and the advantages of propinquity render easy the obtaining of brides from the Parihars  Sesodias and Bhattis  The most numerous bv far of the Kachwaha clan are the Shekhawats  inhabitants of the Xorthern and  b    Nature most ill favoured portion of the Srate  Poverty precludes the paym  nt of the substantial wedding dowrv that is usually demanded and the family is traditionally haunted by the prospect of unmarried girls  There has thus grown up  such a studied neglect of female infant life  both actual and poteiitial  as results in a recor led ratio of 530 female Shekhawats Deliberate infanticide seldom comes to light but there is no doubt for everv 1 000 mal ‘s that unwanted female infants are often so neglected  especially in some clans of Rajputs  that death is the result  In Jaipur State  for  000 little Rajput boys aged from 0 6 there are only 659 little girls  while similar figures for Marwar and Mewar are 856 and 982 respectively  The diagram for the whole population shows that in childhood boys tlirive at the expense of girls and the sudden drop in the proportion of females after the age of 4 bear s testimony to this ”  1  It is probably significant that the ratio of females to males in Rajputana is higher  This is in contrast to the greater part of India  and disregard of girl babies in the remoter areas  comservative It may is suggestive of a were  as might infanticide be e vpected  most out that if frequent here be pointed in families in which daughters were most numerous and absent where many sons and few daughters were born  the ultimate effect would be to perpetuate strains in which males jiredominated at the e xpense of those favouring female births  a point of some importance in connection with the considerations in the following in towns than in rural areas     aragraph  Masculinity  and Decline   A  good deal of recent work on sex ratios has tended to the view that an 79 increase in mascuUnity is an indication of declining population  Clearly that is not the case in India as a whole  On the other hand it may have some correlation to the low rate of increase among Hindus and Jains as compared to that in other religious bodies  as it is among Hindus and Jains that the disharmony resulting    from the low proportion of women is likely to be most acutely felt on account of the non remarriage of widows  It is not unlikely moreover that the caste system itself definitely tends towards a preponderance of masculinity  ^Yestermarck takes the view that a mixture of race leads to an increase in the proportion of females and he cites  History of Human Marriage  pages 476 to 482  3rd edn   a number of observations from various parts of the world to support this view  and quotes incidentally Dr  Nagel s experiments in the self fertilization of plants as producing an exces s of male flowers  several cases of inbreeding herds of cattle in which buU calves greatly exceed heifers  and two independent experiments in horse breeding indicating that fillies predominate among foals in proportion as the sire and dam Heape  arguing from the breeding of dogs  likewise concludes differ in colour  that inbreeding increases masculinity  quoted by Pitt Rivers  Clash of Culture   The obvious inference is that marriage mthin the caste will ultimately  at any rate  increase the proportion of male to female children  and it is worth noticing that the befief that endogamy has this result does not merely arise from modem enquiries into the subject  since the Talmud is quoted as stating that mixed marIt cannot  however  be taken as definitely proved that riages produce only girls  femininity increases with hybridization  as some investigations point in the opposite direction  and it may be noted in passing that among the Andamanese  who are  \fMASCULINITY AND DECLINE   197  certainly decUning faster than any race in India  women exceed men among th« pure bred aborigines  whereas males exceed females among the half breeds  The same is the case with the Cochin Jews  where the White Jews  who are strictly  endogamous and pure bred and who seem to be approaching extinction  number more females than males  whereas the hybridized Black Jews  who show some inThe population concerned is  crease since 1921  have more males than females  however  so small in the cases of the Andamanese and the White Jews that it is not safe to draw any conclusion  but Anglo Indian males exceed Anglo Indian females  whose ratio per 1  000 males is 942  and the disproportion is maintained throughout the reproductive period  Pitt Rivers  while admitting that miscegenation has lowered the excessive masculinity of the pure Maori  attributes this to the greater adaptabihty of the mixed stock to vitally changed conditions and not to the effect of an admixture of blood directly  and  if he is right in this  it is possible that the failure of hybridization to increase the sex ratio in the case of Anglo Indians is symptomatic of a decreased adaptabiUty to an unchanged environment  but on the other hand the Anglo Indian is anything but decreasing in numbers  his inand during the past 50 years 122 9%  crease during the past decade has been 22 The apparent connection therefore between inbreeding and masculinity may be due to some other factor hitherto not appreciated  At the same time the fact remains that there is a good deal of evidence to support the theory that inbred or pure blooded societies produce an excess of males  and Miss King’s exjDeriments with rats  quoted by Pitt Rivers  op  cit   afforded evidence that the normal sex ratio could be changed by breeding from litters which contained an excess of males  Mr  Sedgwick  in the Bombay Census Report for 1921  pointed out that the Indian caste system with its exogamous gotra and endogamous caste “ is a perfect method •  4%  •  The endogamy prevents of preserving what is called in Genetics the ‘ pure line ’  external hybridisation  while the  internal  exogamy prevents the possibility of a fresh pure line arising within the old one by the isolation of any character not co on to the whole line  With the preservation of the pure line the perpetuation of all characters common to it necessarily follows ” W^hether this proposition be entirely acceptable or not  it may be conceded that if once a caste  whether as a result of inbreeding or of some totally different factor  has acquired the natural condition of having an excess of males  this condition is likely to be perpetuated as long as inbreeding is maintained  Caste therefore would appear to be of definite assistance to the Hindu in his superlative anxiety for male children moreover  since the higher the caste the stricter  in the past at any rate  the ban on external exogamy  this tendency would show more patently in the higher caste and explain why the proportion of females to males increases in inverse ratio to social status  In any case it would be interesting to have reliable statistics of the sexes of the offspring of intercaste marriages   mm     80  It is not  however  only Hindu society which suffers in India from a shortage of females  though in  the case of Muslims  as also of Christians and of the Black above referred to  the original stock from which the community has been recruited must have been very largely Hindu originally and may therefore be still influenced by the proclivities encouraged by previous inbreeding  Local conditions may also have some bearing on the case  as the proportion of females to males is much higher in the damp climate of the south and east than in the drier Deccan and north west  though here again it is not safe to infer  as was inferred in 1921 Jew s  by Marten  that climate is responsible for the ratio  since in that case the ratio of females to males should be still higher in the Nicobars than in Madras  In the Mcobars  however  the indigenous ratio is 927 females to every 1 000 males  while in the Andamans  where the basis of the local born population is drawn from all over India and Burma and where the climate approximates to that of Madras and Burma  the ratio is far less  366 female births being recorded The Andamans figures rather for every 1 000 males among non Andamanese  suggest that race is more likely to be the responsible factor than climate  One other factor has to be mentioned and that is the great reduction of recent years in mortality from famine  The India Census Report of 1911  pages 220 222  adduces some evidence to suggest that famine leads to a higher mortality among males  and may therefore function as a corrective to an excessive male ratio  so that a reduction of mortality from famine would automatically reduce the ratio of females to males  M22CC     Sex  Ratio  and communitx   \f198  CHAPTER V    SEX   of females to males increases inversely is well illustrated by the figures for This with social standing among Hindus  has been divided up according to population Bombay where the whole Hindu

females  number  be reckoned in with Bom   bay  only  it  raises  the  ratio  for  Muslim women  to 829 per 1 000 males  These figures are possibly not quite representative as they  stand   since  many of the Muslims  in Bombay  while  climatic  may  are immigrants  factors or racial  enter in since Sind is preponderaM uslim as compared to tingly Bombay Presithe rest of the and as has already been dency  stated  the preponderance of males is greater in the dry areas in the north west of India  whatever the  reason may be  The figures are  however  generally indicative of the fact that the preponderance of males over females is certainly no less among Muslims generally than among Hindus  It is i  robable that some proportion of the excess number of males both among Sluslims and Brahmans or other high class Hindus is to be accoiiated for by the piird ih system  not so much because  any deliberate concealment it makes the household generally more difficult  there  is  of females  as because of access  to the enumerator   who  might be tempted to put down the  names of the members of the household personally known to him and unknown  among to omit those  whom the women of the household would  naturally preponderate  to avoid having to make himself a nuisance to the inmates  There is  however  no reason to believe that the short enumeration of women due to this cause accounts for more than a very small part of the excess of males disclosed by the census  The Census Superintendent for Bombay has argued with some plausibility for the view that in the north west of India  particularly among Muslims  the census returns have consistently understated the number of females between 0 and 15  \fSEX RATIO AND COMMUNITY   199  on account of indifference to their existence or of deliberate concealment his arguments are attractive  but fail to account for the fact that the ratio of    females aged 0 1 is much higher than the total ratio  whereas it is just at that period that it might be expected to be least  not only on account of the ^eater number of males born but because concealment would presumably be just as active a factor at that age as during the next 10 years or so while indifference might be expected to be possibly even more active  nor does it account for the The all India existence of a progressive decline in the ratio from census to

Central Provinces can be added if Berar be excluded  Berar taken together males have exceeded females for the lirst time since 1891  though in the natural population alone females still exceed males  In Burma again if Burmese alone be taken there is an excess of women over men  and the excess of males  as in the Federated Malay States  is due entirely to the immigration of Conversely the excess of females in Bihar and 13rissa  in the foreign males  Central Provinces  other than Berar  and in Madras is partly accounted for by the emigration of males  The excess in Bihar and Orissa is mainly in Chota Xagpur and Orissa  including the States  If the natural as distinct from the actual populations of these nrovinces be taken  there is a ratio of 1 004 females per 1 000 males iu Bihar and Oiissa and the Central Provinces  984 females   er 1 000 males Where females are in e xcess the 1 010 females per 1 000 males in Madras  excess is still most marked in the lower ca stes and does not always extend to the higher  Thus in Bihar and Orissa there are 964 Brahman females to every 1 000 Brahman males  but in the Hari caste there are 1 009 females to every 1 000 males  Similarly in the Central Provinces there are 863 Brahman females to 1 00  males  but 965 Sonar    017 Kalar and 1 117 Ghasia females to 1 000 male^ of their l•e speotive The aboriginal tribes which have retained their tribal religions show for castes  India as a whole  an excess of females per 1 000  males  their ratio being 1 009  For British Territory there is a decidedly higher ratio of 1 018 females to every 1 000 males  which is mainly due to the high ratio of females  1  025 pel  1  000 males  among the non Hinduised tribes of Chota Xagpur and the Santa 1 Parganas  since elsewhere except in Burma  1 021  and in Madras  1 006 females   er 1  000 males  the tribal population shows a slight excess of males  the ratio beinu on the average 994 females per 1  000 FEM ALES PER ICXDO males  It seems likely  m     MALES  that  jS  j   I  tills high ratio females among the aborigines of  of  Chota Xagpur and of the Agency Tracl s of IMadras is partly due to  the recruiting of  males for labour on the Assam tea gai dens  and the  figures  for  emigiation to Assam confirm the supposition  as the Census Superintendent for that prortnee remarks on the very poor recruitment of women coolies during the decade  The ratio is higher in the Bihar and Ayeaf O t  AC£aaas  HHH  Orissa States  1 038  and in Chota Nagpur  \f          200  CHAPTER V    SEX    1 040  than in the Santal Parganas though for Indian States generally there are only 993 tribal females per 1  000 males  Generally speaking however  except in the Nicobars the numbers of the sexes are fairly well balanced in non Hinduised tribes  being much more nearly equal than in either Hindus or Muslims in India as a whole  The general conclusion as to the sex ratios of the population as a whole of India proper is therefore that in the aboriginal tribes the numbers of the two sexes are approximately equal  whereas in the rest of the community males exceed females  The all India ratio of the latter per 1 000 of the former is lowest among Sikhs  782 for India as a whole   next lowest among MusHms  901   and is 951 among Hindus but this higher ratio is only maintained as compared to Muslims if the whole population be taken

however  of the immediate increase or decrease of population the sex ratio of the total community is of less importance than the sex ratio of the breeding part of it  since on account of age or immaturity a considerable proportion of the population is neutral as regards reproduction  IfVe examine the relath e proportions of females aged 1 5 to 45 and of males aged 2    to 50  which mav be taken to represent roughly the breeding age period of the population of India  it becomes immediately apparent that the proportion of female to male is generally higher than it is when the Females

for fifty years  Delhi and the Andaman Islands have been purposely omitted on account of the artificial composition of their populations  Apart from Coorg  where as already pointed out the low female ratio seems quite out of place and which calls for some special explanation not yet forthcoming  the position of three provinces excites comment  Assam might be expected to figure lower down in the list  the Nicobars lower still  and the Central Provinces on the contrar   higher up  The probability is that Assam and the Central Provinces are inveisely affected by migration  that is by able bodied males of the reproductive ages immigrating to the first as tea garden labour and emigrating from the other in the same capacity  The figures of the  Nicobars  with their very small population  have been to some extent biassed by the presence of       \f      REPRODUCTIVE PERIOD   201  foreign traders and the crews of Chinese pearling boats  etc   whose comparatively small numbers are nevertheless enough to impair the balance of the sex reIf these be excluded the number of Nicobarese females per 1  000 Nicobarese males is 927 and if the reproductive ages only be considered  it becomes 991  Taking India as a whole therefore  the sex ratio is very far from being as unfavourable to a progressive population as the total sex figures suggest at first sight  At the same time it must not be forgotten that the point at which the number of females is adequate to the number of males is limited to the ages from 15 to 30  and the probability is that their deficiency from the ages of 30 to 60 is due to exhaustion by breeding as soon as the reproductive period is reached  The Age of Consent Committee reports as follows  turns         “ Inquiries into a large number of cases show that when the marriage of young people is consummated at an early age  say  when the boy is not more than 16 years or the girl is 12 or 13  a fairly large percentage of wives die of phthisis or some other disease of the respiratory organs or from some o  arian complication within 10 years of the consummation of marriage ”   The earher deficiency is also responsible  since were the excess of females in age group 0 5 maintained till group 15 to 20 the parity between the sexes would be maintained for a greater period after that point  Actually more males are born but there are more females in age group 0 5  after which the sudden drop in the ratio may be taken to indicate the effect of discriminative neglect in favour of male children during the earlier years  The Census Superintendent for Bombay comes   among others  to the following definite conclusion     “ The death rate amongst females is higher than amongst males in the 5 to 10 years age group this is due to the neglect of female children  There is no rehable evidence showing whether the tendency to neglect female children is more powerful in certain communities and castes than in others  Imt prima facie it is probable that neglect of female children varies to some extent with economic circumstances  A study of the specific death rates shows that after the age of 5 only in the 40 and over age groups is the female death rate lower than the male  65  8 per cent  of the female population is aged between 5 and 40 so that the heavy    death rate aSects the larger proportion of the female population ”  There are more females again at 20 to 25 and for the third time more females at  AOVLi^l  70  Curves to show numbers living in India  at different age periods   70 and over   The dip in the age curv e for 1931

children   and the fact that the curve rises between 20 and 30 illustrates the fact that those dangers are not limited to the birth of the first born  but continue as the result of subsequently bearing too many and too frequent children  or as the result of disorders and diseases arising from child birth   In the margin I give the sex ratio at the They are various age periods for 1921 and 1931  most striking  Here we see at once that whereas the sex ratio in deaths has fallen since 1921 at all other ages  it has risen at the reproductive ages of 15 30  viz     This bears out what I have said elsewhere    that in the absence of selective epidemic  diseases the effect of the usual very high mortality of females at the reproductive  ages  becomes  more noticeable  and so the sex ratio in deaths  rises ”  In Cochin State on the other hand these conditions have been remedied “ Further a steady rise in the age of marriage consequent on the rapid progress of female  education in the State and the gradual displacement of primitive methods of midwifery by modern and scientific methods have considerably reduced the dangers which almost all women have to face  and lowered the death rate among young mothers to an appreciable extent  The gradual rise in the sex ratio is but the natural outcome of these improved conditions ” It is necessary now to examine the figures by certain religions in the same manner  Communities in which the women outnumber the men  figures of which present no abnormal features  need not perhaps occupy our attention further  Thus indigenous Burmese races show no marriages under 5 years and very few indeed under 10 years  and their total figures of married persons show a slight excess of females which is in no way remarkable  Indian figures are of course very difierent  In India as a whole in all except tribal communities the males outnumber the females  in spite of which we find a progressive instead of a regressive population  and at the same time the contradictory condition in many places that parents of sons are able to demand considerable sums from parents anxious to obtain husbands for daughThe latter  custom is of course partly due to the rule that a girl must be marriters  ed before puberty  a point to which reference must be made in the next chapter  while the progressive nature of the population has already been indicated when pointing out that the inequality between the sexes was less at the reproductive ages than when taken as a whole  It is from this point of view that communities must be examined individually  Taking the Hindus it  appears that there are 54 473 448 females of the reproductive ages to 51 450 266 males  an excess of three million or 1 059 females to every 1 000 males  In the case of the Hindus however the factor of the ban on widow remarriage is important  for there are 8 313 773 widows at the reproductive ages and when these are excluded the female excess is reduced to a deficiency of over five milhon  of over 10 per cent  that is  leaving only 897 per 1 000 males  Similarly among Jains the exclusion of widows leaves a deficiency of nearly 20 per cent  of females in the reproductive period  Sikhs have an actual deficiency of over of females cent  at the per reproductive period in any case  and though a con15 siderable number of their potentially reproductive males remain unmarried in consequence  they are  compared to Hindus  Christian  Muslim Hindu Jain  males      and  a late marrpng community  remarriage of widows is not 1921 1931 20 50  banned  In the case of the Muslims there 32 1 080 is an excess of females  1 026 per 1 000 13 l 02f  males  at the reproductive period  in spite 10 897» 810» 6 of the fact that the female ratio for the whole population is only 901 per 1 000 The Christians have a still greater excess of females at the reproductive  Community   Increase percent   Females 15 45 per 1 000 males  Jains   while the  After exclusion of widows   \f           SEX BATIO BY CASTE   203  It seems likely that ages  taving 1 080 females per 1 000 males of that period  these proportions have some definite bearing on the rates of increase in the different  communities  It offers an explanation of the particularly small rate of increase of Jains  and a reason why Hindus have increased at a slower rate than Muslims  The comparative rate of Hindu increase would be lower still were it not for the large additions received from tribal communities  a source of recruitment which The exf’eptionally high Christian rate of increase will not be available indefinitely  is of course similarly affected by the inclusion of converts  but the sex ratio is probably contributive  In the case of the Sikhs  which is v ory obviously an instance to the contrary  it is impossible to ascerVariation Females 15 tain what proportion of the abnormal per cent per l OfK  maleo Commur ity  increa se is due to accretions from Hinduism  20  1921 1931    0  Considerable numbers of Hindus  particularly of the caste  Arora are reported to 848 Sikh  r34  15 1 143 Tribal have turned Sikh in the Punjab  and there is some evidence of a considerable propaganda about the time of the census to induce depressed castes in tlie Punjab to return themselves as Sikhs  Sahejdhari Sikhs who returned themselves as Hindu in 1921 may have returned themselves as Sikh in 1931  and it is more than probable that this was the case in the Punjab  where they can register as voters in Sikh constituencies by making a declaration that they are Sikhs  In some pro dnces  e g   Sind   there have been extraordinary fluctuations in the numbers returned as Sikhs probably on account of a varying classification of Sahejdhari The Sind variations are mentioned below  Chapter XI  para  165  and must cau se the exceptional increase of 1931 to be regarded with much reserve  The percentages of variation in Sind  where there were 127 000 Sikhs returned in 1881  were 99 100 in 1901  In 1911 12 000 were returned and the variations in 1891 and for 1921 and 1931 were 42 per cent  and  164 per cent  In any case it is likely that the practice of late marriage by the community in general would tend to a higher birth rate  or rather a higher sur ’ival rate  since it seems clear that premature maternity is likely not only to deplete the number of married women in the later age groups of the reproductive period but to reduce the number If this be so the same consideration would of healthy children born to them  apply to the analogous case of the Anglo Indians already mentioned above  Another striking case which at first sight appears to conflict with the h^ pothesis proposed is that of the Tribal Religions which suffer a decrease of 15 per cent  in spite of the very favourable sex ratio of 1 143 females to 1 000 males in the reproductive period  It will be seen from the figures given in Chapter XI that this decrease can be entirely attributed to transfers from Tribal Religions to Hinduism and to Christianity  but chiefly to the former  In this connection a reference may be made to the diagram of the sex ratios at the last four censuses at paragraph 80 above  It will be noticed that the Christian and Sikh commimities  which have both shown very remarkable increase in population at this census  have had a rising female ratio for the past two decades  and it is possible that the rising female ratio of the AngloIndians from 1911 to 1921 is also intimately associated with their 1931 increase  in which case the falling ratio of 1921 31 should indicate a much reduced rate of No other community has sho^vn any increase in increase after 1941 if not before  since except the sUght increases during the past decade among ratio female 1911  the and Tribes  The steadily falhng ews Muslim ratio is of some importance and Jains J lead to the cessation of the liigh inevitably increase in that communitv  must It is possibly to be imputed to the observance of the purdah system bv the poorer classes and the consequent prevalence of consumption and early mortality among women  It also suggests a possible lowering of the age of marriage and maternitv                       82  An examination of the sex ratio by caste might be expected to show an immediate correlation to the ratio of prevalence of infant marriage to wliich allusion is made in the next chapter  whereas at first sight these ratios appear in almost inverse relationship  It must however be borne in mind first that tlie ratio of the prevalence of infant marriage has been calculated on the number of married aged 0 6 only  excluding all figures of marriage for girls beyond that age group and secondly that the mere ceremony of marriage cannot of itself affect the ratio  The practices which govern the female ratio in India  apart from possible chmatic or racial factors  the nature  degree and verj  existence of which are doubtful  are those relating to the care of female children and to too early and too frequent maternity   M22CC  Sex Ratio by Caste   \f      CHAPTEE V   204   SEX   neither of which have any necessary connection with the

control the ratio of the sexes in the total  population of every caste ”  may be made in this connection to the marginal table and diagram above  paragraph 80  in which the difference between the female ratio in the first year of life and the female ratio for the population as a whole is clearly indicated  Only two purely Mushm groups have been tabulated and of these the figure for Sa  yids is so low as to make it doubtful if it represents a complete enumeration of the females of the group  This doubt arises from an examinaPathan which  though available from tion of the returns under the head very low ratio of 864 females per 1 000 males eight provinces and states  afford the Pathans enumerated were temporary and suggest that either some of the scope of census enumeration  e g   in

latter again it must not be are Hindu castes or primitive tribes  forgotten that under one head are sometimes included not only tribesmen living a detached and tribal life in their own hills but also Hinduised tribesmen whose life and customs are hardly if at all distinguishable from those of other castes occupying Sawara includes not only the hillmen of the Ganjam the same areas  Thus Agency whose fife and religion is purely tribal  but the Saharias of Gwalior who are completely Hinduised  This difference is perhaps reflected in their sex ratios  for the Gwalior Saharias have only 977 females per 1 000 males whereas the Madras branch of the tribe have 1 024 and the G  P  branch 1 043  It has already been pointed out that the highest female ratio is generally to be found either among primitive tribes or low castes  among both of whom marital cohabitation does not usually take place till approximate maturity  is reached  The sex ratio is also similarly’ high among the mammakkathayam communities of the Malabar coast where female children are no less cared for than male and where  owing to the prevalence of adult marriage very early  maternity is unusual   A  reference  ‘  ‘  ’  Section ii  Fertility  tatistics   ’   Fertility   83 Figures of the size and composition of famihes  and statistics bearing on the rate of propagation in India are so inadequate that it was decided to attempt to obtain some figures of fertility at this census in spite of the many difficulties  The figures obtained vdll be found in Appendix I to Part ii  Tables  of this volume  Financial consideratiocis were one obstacle and others were the difficulty of getting    \f   SEX OF FIRST BORN   205  ordinary enumerators  and the still greater difficulty of getting suitable persons to carry out the rather delicate enquiries needed for this purpose  In Baroda State the enquiries made were particularly careful and thorough  and the Census Commissioner for that State  Mr  S  V  Mukerjea  has dealt admirably   ath the whole subject in his report  In Travancore also 105 000 returns were collected  of which only 2 7 per cent  had to be rejected  and they have been carefully discussed in In the United Pro ’inces the Local Government decided detail by Dr  Pillai  that no such enquiries could be made  but in most other provinces and states some attempt was made to obtain figures of fertility  Various agencies were used  generally educational or medical  and wherever possible the figures were collected through women  The total number of families for which returns of some kind were obtained was about 900 000 drawn from all grades of society and  except the United Provinces  from every part of India  so that the resulting figures may be taken as a well mixed sample  though admittedly inadequate numerically  As the information obtained was very variable in degree and quality it was necessary to reject for one table or another those returns which were inadequate in some respect  and in consequence tlie numbers dealt with in each table fall very far short of the total number of returns received  amounting in some cases to less than half  In the tables volume gross figures have been compiled for India  with sub totals by all communities for whicli more than one pro  fincial figure exists  Thus in the case of Hindus a sub total of Other Interior Castes has been comon the other hand no separate subpiled  and a further sub total of Yadavas total of Bafinda appears  as a separate figure for this caste is available for one state only  and as it can be found in the pro fincial figures there was no object in repeating the total for India  The figures that follow in this chapter are those compiled for India only  and for pTo  incial or state sub totals it will be necessary to refer to the Tables volume  ‘  ’     84 The first statement shows the proportion of male and female children returned as the first born of the families examined  Whether Jastrzebski’s theory that the sex of subsequent births is influenced in the direction of masculinity or femininity by the sex of the first child be valid or not  it is likely that males will predominate among the first born  as it seems to be a universal phenomenon that although fewer survive infancy more males are actually bom than females  and this majority can hardly fail to be reflected in the proportions of male to female first born  In any case the enquiry in Burma showed that in 61 per cent  of the families in which a girl was born first female children predominated  and in 75 per cent  of those in which the first born was a boy  male children predominated  but the figures dealt cvith were not large  In Baroda  however  the figures Number Number of 29 000 families yielded precisely the same of females of females percentages  The corresponding percentfirst bom per 1 000 Province or State  per 1 000 males in ages in Travancore were 52 and 61  The males natural

duration of marriage  and the age of the wife at the time of marriage  No account is taken of still born children and such are not counted as births at all in any of these tables  The general percentage of sterility in marriages that have lasted 15 years and over is 6 per cent  This percentage falls in the case of wives married under 12 years to 2 per cent  but the numbers available are few and the percentage unreliable for that reason  There is less reason to doubt the result in the case of wives married at 13 to 14 years of age when the percentage of sterihty is only 4  rising to 7 in the case of wives married above the age of 14 years  These results have  however  to be read with those obtained from the next table which shows the average size of the family correlated to the age of the wife at marriage  Here we find that while the average number of children born from wives married at all ages is 4 2 and the survdval rate 2 9  both the niimber born and the survival rate seem to increase with the age of the wife at marriage and are at the highest for wives married at 30 years and over  5 1 and 3 6 respectively  while for wives married at 20 to 30 years they are 4 3 and 3 1  The general inference is that although an increase in the age of marriage for girls slightly increases the risk of the marriage proving sterile  possibly on account of greater exposure to sterilizing diseases  it also increases the number of children born alive when the marriage is  as it will be in at least 92 per cent  of cases  fertile  and it likewise increases the probability of survival to the children     •  •  Statement II  Proportion of fertile and sterile marriages  Duration of Marriage   Age of wife at     r~  0 4 years   marriage   5 9 years   10 14 years   15 years and longer A

general average size of family is exceedingly constant about the number 4 In five instances it rises to 5 0 or over  the maximum being 5 6 but in three of these cases the numbers dealt with are very low  In the other two  where the numbers are higher  the rate may perhaps  be accepted  These two are the orders of Religion and of Persons living on their Income  In the latter the survival rate is also high  as might be expected  712 per 1  000  though not as high as in the case of Law  Medicine and Instruction where the sur dval rate is 760 per 1 000 while the average family is only 3 7 Apparently physicians  if unable to heal themselves  can yet heal tlieir children  At any rate this is the highest survival rate found in any occupation  the next Iiighest being those of the families of men employed in textile industries and in the Army  731 and 729 respectively  with average families of 3 7 and 3 6 Public administration comes next with an average family of 3 9 and a survival rate of 721 per The lowest smvival rates  all those below 600 in fact  are calculated on 1 000 figures too small to be worth considering  but it is possibly significant that the survival rate in Industry as a whole is only 687 children per 1 000 born  though the general level is in the neighbourhood of 700 and Class C  Public Administration and Liberal Arts  as a whole has the rate of 716 but with smaller families              •                       Statement IV  Size of families by occupation of husband      y  B Totals in this table include figures which could not adopted in compilation

marriage by  community   •     Th   fifth statement correlates the duration of marriage with tlie community  of the married and the  number of quick  births   and dealing with considerably  larger numbers the average number of children born falls to 3 ’9  the lowest general figure yielded by any of these tables  but this of course is determined by the fact  that large numbers of the marriages examined are incomplete  In marriages of ten to nineteen years duration the average number of children born is four and in marriages of 33 years duration and over it is 5 8 rising in the case of a few Kurmi marriages to 9  and in that of one Jewish family to 10  In Buddhist families on the other hand  where marriage is late  the average number born falls in cases of duration over 33 years and is at its highest in marriages of 20 to 31 years duration with an average per family of 6  1  only equalled in that duration term by Christians and Kurmis with the same number  The latter however rise to 7 0 in the later duration term in wliich the Buddhist average falls  Some conclusions can also be drawn from this table as to the frequency of births  the general inference being that two childi en are born alive during the fir st few years of marriage and that afi er ten years of married life have been accomplished the rate is approximately 1 child per decade up to 32 y ears of marriage  In the sixth statement  which correlates the size of family to its community  the number of families examined is again rather fewer  and the total survival rate for 1 000 children born alive appears as 700 instead of the 697 yielded by Table lY  700 being approximately the figure obtained hkewise from Table III  The average per family  4 3 in Table IV  is 4 2 by Tables III and VI  though it rises to 6 3 for Kaya sthas and falls to 2  5 for Bhils  In the latter case the low birthrate is compensated for by a high survival rate  741  but the nomadic ca stes who have an average family of only 3 3 do not reach the general standard survival rate of 700  having one of 651 only  no doubt indicating the effects of their habits of •  •  The lowest survival rates are shown by Kurmis and Chamars  both under 600 and both having the majority of their wives married under 15 years of ao^e whereas the Sikh with the majority married over that age has a survival rate of 714 and the same combination of a high survival rate with a late age of wives at marriage appears in Parsis  Christians and above all in Buddhists  but the number dealt with in the first and third of these three communities is regrettably small  while Muslims  also with a majority of marriages with the wife aged 15 or over  have a survival rate of one below the general standard  life   \ff  4  •  OP FAMILY AND DURATION OP MARRIAGE BY

the absence of details by age of wife at marriage for 2 406 families from Bengal and for 22 from the Andaman Islands   General Conciusions   88  It may be added in conclusion that the numbers examined in these ferticonclusions except on the broader lines  It is tables hardly admitof sale the results obtained that for India as a whole bear a reasonable unlikely not  approximation to the general average for the whole country  deduced as they are from returns from half a million families or more of all kinds and conditions  On the other hand no broad generalization from the individual figures of a single There is also some doubt as caste can be regarded as of very much authority  to how far the returns given by the persons questioned represent really accurate statements of fact  At the same time the general conclusion may fairly be drawn that the average married woman in India has four children born alive and that 2 9 that is  survive  It is interesting to note that the Census Superin every four  70 •  %  intendent of Bombay arrives at a similar conclusion from a calculation based on the number of persons of varying ages per 1 000 houses  It may also be concluded that raising the age of marriage for women will not reduce the number of children but will increase the proportion of those that survive  It may be added that although in all provinces ‘ baleful prophecies were rife  ’  to the effect that the enquiry into fertility would arouse resentment and opposition and would have serious consequences  the prophets proved both false and foolish   none of these things  A few people took umbrage at them  were did not obliged to answer  and the collection of information but those that and more efficient than in the attempts made in was much easier 1921  The

he or she were unmarried  married or widowed  Divorced persons who had not remarried were to be entered in the third category  The instructions as regards the second category were that a woman who had never been married should be shown in the first category even though she w ere a prostitute or concubine  but that persons recognised by custom as married w^ere to be entered as such even though they had not been througli any proper ceremony  while persons living together whose religious or social tenets allowed cohabitation without prelimiimry formalities were likewise to be entered as married  The intention was to widen as far as possible the definition of marriage as used in 1921  since it is in no way the concern of the census whether a couple are legally married to one another or to other persons or not at all  if they are living together in such a manner as to beget Prostitutes who may be married to a god are rightly children and form a family  the conditions of enumeration permit  from the census return far as excluded  as though they may have children occasionally no family unit is since married  of  Instructions for  enumeration  constituted   90 The general statistics of Civil Condition will be found in Table VII of part ii  and the figures of selected castes in Table VIII  Proportional figures are embodiecl    It is evident at the first in the subsidiary tables at the end of this chapter  glance that the returns of Civil Condition are in very marked contrast to the The marginal figures show the number of males figures of previous decades

increase in 1931  for the number of married males under 15 has risen bv 51% and the number of married females under 15 by 26% since 1921  an increase which is undoubtedly due to the enormous number of infant marriages wdiicli took place in the six months’ interval between the passing of the Sarda Act and its coming into operation  some account of w hich has been given below  On the other hand Hindu widows under the age of 15 have fallen from 8 per mille in 1921 to 5 5 per mille  but while this may be taken as indicating a real decrease it is to be feared that the figures for the married cannot be taken at their face value  It is an obvious and striking fact that  although in all previous cen sus figures the number of married women exceeds the number of married men  as must necessarily be the case in a country where there are a considerable number of polygy nous  marriages  on this occasion the figures are entirely reversed  in 1931  Persons returned as “ married presenting the

of the composition of families in a very limited area in Mysore disclosed 17 per cent  of co wives to wives in Muslim and 3 per cent  in Hindu families  both a great deal higher rates than 8 per mille  21o  The statistics   \fCHAPTER VI   216  arisen of marrying males to a goddesh   CIVIL CONDITION   nor can the excess of married males in 1G 31 be imputed to a sudden increase of polyandrous marriages  It is true that there are in the Himalayas a certain number of tribes or castes practising polyandry  Most of them are Buddhists  and finding  as we do  that married males exceed married females in that community  if Burmese Buddhists be excluded  and that this is a recurrent feature of Indian census returns  we may accept that excess as An excess of Christian married males over married females is also a normal correct  feature of Indian census returns  and may be imputed primarily to the numbers This excess of married British soldiers  officials  etc   whose wives are in Europe  of Christian married males is noticeably less than usual 6 046 as compared to The excess is absent in the case of Tribal 16 887 in 1921 and 19 656 in 1911  Religions and of Sikhs in both of which communities prepuberty marriage is very rarely if e   er practised and in which the married women exceed the married men the uirrratru al excess carr therefore be ascribed to Hindus  Jairrs and MusHms  It is not difficult to divine the cause  at any rate in the main  In all these communities early marriage is   ractised  and the Sarda Act came into force a year before the   ciisus  Although that Act has in practice been virtually a dead letter  it is certain that a considerable number of persons who have married off their children in contravention of the Act will have hesitated to state specifically that a child aged so and so  and Age may be asked by the enumerator before Civil Condition  is married  knowing that such a statement will lay him open to the possibility of prosecution  Moreover in at least one case a Brahman association had bound its members not to divulge marriages made in contravention of the new law  The fact that the number of such concealments has been so much greater in the case of females than of males as to reverse the proportions of the married is the natural consequence of the fact that the bride is normally younger than the bridegroom and the impulse to conceal the age is therefore more frequent  It may be here added that more than one attempt was made to use the census schedules as evidence for prosecution under the Sarda Act  so that the fear of those who returned their married daughters under 14 as unmarried w as not entirely ill found  d  It was ultimately ruled that the schedule had to be produced  an indicatifiii of faulty legislative provision for the protection of the census enquiry  but fortunately by that time the records had been compiled and the original schedule    dc   troyed in accordance with the customary procedure           Correction of error   91 It is necessary therefore to arrive at some computation of the error inTlic jrojmrtion of married males and fem ales  as returned in 1931  are volved  1 007 males to every 1 000 females  or 993 married females to every 1 000 married Mow an examination of the sex proportions of the last fifty years shows males  that tbe number of married females per 1 000 mairied male s varies from 1 005 to 1 011  and the numlxu  of marri  d males per 1 000 married females from 989 to t 93  The average works out at 1 008 married females  or 992 married males  per 1 000 married of the oy posite    ex  The existence of concealment of the uiarria ge  4 females makes it more than piobable that there has been concealment of tlie marriage of male   also  but for the j urposes of this conqjutation ne  e  ssary to assume tliat the number of miales returned as married i   correct it cleaiiy it is a minimum  Xow to maintain the average marriage ratio of the past fifty yeai s 85 000 000 married females are required  and for the lowest ratio foimd  that of 1891  at least 84 653 970 married females are required  w’hereas the actual numb  r retmned is 83 607 223  M e are therefore brought to the unvcelcoine conclusion that at the very least 1 046 747 married femiaies have been returned as unmarried  and that all the  ^e are nnder the age of 14 years  since otherwise there       would be no purpose in concealing their married condition  In all probability the number is not less than one and a quarter million  Taking the low est figure the ratio of females aged 0 15 w’ho are married becomes 196 per 1 000 instead of the ratio of 181 indicated by the returns  an increase of 52 in every 1 000 married females aged 0 15  that is of at least 36 per cent  on the ratio of 1921  or con  ^iderably more than the 13 per cent  shown by the unquahfied figures  and a reversion beyond the position of 1 891  An attempt wall be made below to distribute this concealment of married females as betw een different communities  but it is not possible to locate or to distribute it with any certainty as between diiferent provinces  It is imUkely that much concealment has taken place in Indian States which have had no legislation comparable to the Sarda Act  and it may be taken as certain that Cochin and Travancore States have contributed little or nothing        \f   5  CORRECTION OF ERROR   217  On the other to it  since infant marriage is not practised on the Malabar Coast  hand it is inferred by the Census Superintendent for Rajputana from the statistics provided by that Agency that “ recent legislation  although inapplicable to the States  has apparently had the efiect of hastening on the marriages of immature persons of both sexes ” It is possible however that this lowering of the age of  marriage may be partially due  as pointed out  elsewhere   to the automatic and  inevitable action of the existing sex ratio aggravated by the ban on widow remarIn some cases a denial of marriage at the census may have been the result riage  of failure  by the bridegroom s party to provide the dovfry promised  as cases of  this kind are reported to have led to attempted repudiation of the marriage  when actual excess of 864 125 the census took place  in Tippera district in Bengal   An  married males is to be found in Burma and in Benga 1 together  In Burma however they are all immigrants whose wives are likely to be found mostly in Madras or in the United Provinces  and the Burmans themselves do not in any case practise infant marriage  wliile Bengal usually has an excess of married males  mostly immigrants to Calcutta  equal to less than two thirds of their excess at this census  It has already been shown that this excess of 600 000 odd does not by any means represent the actual shortage of married females in the returns  92  In considering the statistics there is another point which has to be borne  Qfoup blw   The method recommended by the actuary  in mind as regards the age groups   who examined the 1921 returns has been described in Chaper IV  and has greatly This improvement however cannot  improved the value of the returns of age   equally be postulated of the age groups by civil condition  Under the old system of sorting directly into quinquennial groups there was a very heavy accumulation of returns at the ages ending in the digits 5 or 0  but the consequent error was the same for both Age by itself or Age as a factor in Civil Condition  The method adopted at this census has improved the returns of age vdthout effecting an equivalent improvement in the age groups when read with civil condition  as the number of individuals of any civil condition is not identical with the total returns of any given age  Thus of those returned as aged 14 16 there vvdll be a greater number married at the latter age than at the former  and by dividing the group into equal halves of which one contributes to the group 10 15 and the other to the group 15 to 20  the numbers of married shown in the lower age group mil be increased beyond their correct proportion and conversely the number of unmarried in the higher group will also be proportionately inflated  The error caused will only be seriously operative up to the point at which the vast majority become all of the same married condition  and again at the point at which many become widowed and it would appear from the returns that its effect has been to counterbalance the tendency to over estimate the age of young married females which has been indicated in all previous census returns  An excellent example of the actual effect of the working of the method of smoothing on the ages of the married and widowed will be found in the following table which is taken from the

group 5    10  will be misleading   20  this  volume  On the other  hand it must unfortunately be pointed out that the necessity of allowing for an adjustment of not less than one milfion girls returned as unmarried though actually married has to be balanced against the bias indicated above  to say nothing of the tendency to exaggerate the ages of young married girls  When allowing for the adjustment of misstated civil condition  the age bias  inflating group 5 10 as regards the married  may be regarded as operating to adjust the difficulty of distributing to different groups the numbers of those inaccurately returned as unmarried It will of course be quite clear that this corrective was not intentional  in 1931  and would have been avoided had the bias given to the returns of Civil Condition been detected in time  This could easily have been done by sorting for civil condition before sorting for age  but when the Census Superintendent of Bengal  the fust of us to detect the bias  pointed it out  sorting had everywhere been completed  Ages as stated to enumerators in India are always so inaccurate  and the old method of grouping imder ivhich the age returns were influenced by preferential digits was so unsatisfactory  that it cannot be held that the inaccuracy of the grouping by Civil Condition is necessarily any greater at this census than in previous decades  but it probably is  and in any case it is unfortimate that the greater accuracy which might have been obtained by reversing the order of sorting must be deferred to the next census  and even if the method used has acted as a corrective in one respect it would have been more satisfactory to have been able to ascertain that error precisely and to apply the necessary corrective afterwards  Meanwhile it is necessary to bear in mind this flaw in grouping when considering the increase in infant marriage disclosed in the returns which form another point in striking contrast to those of recent decades  Were the returns of married females complete it would be clear that some allowance would have to be made for the tendency tov ards weighting the lower ages at the expense of the As however it must be taken as quite certain that some million higher  married girls under 14 years of age have been returned as unmarried  and in all     probability a still larger number of girls and a considerable number of boys  the returns as they stand may be taken as an indication correct enough of the proportion of married at the more infantile ages  and to correct the weighting caused by the method of grouping the correction necessary in the figures of the married may be made to fall entirely at the highest age groups possible  For the purposes therefore of the marginal table a transfer of 1 046 747 females has been made from the category of unmarried to that of married and shown entirely under the highest age group under 15 years  The weighting of the lower age groups will be more apparent in the Married persons per 1 000 of the population aged case of the  widowed  Otol   Census of  1  to 2   2 to 3   3 to 4   Not only the  will  tendency  for the returns M  1881 1891 1901

therefore greater  but the inclination to concealment or to exaggerate age will perhaps have been less  in which case the bias involved by the method of sorting will be less balanced by its operation

the actual state of widowhood as presented by the 1931 census figures is actually a little better than it appears to be from the record  indicating a very remarkable decrease in the number of child widows during the last ten years  It is to be feared that unless the practice of the remarriage of child widows is greatly extended during the coming decade  the reduction found at this census will be found in 1941 to have been converted again to a grave increase as a result of the great increase that took place during the early months of 1930 in child marriages hurriedly undertaken to forestall the Sarda Act  Indeed the year that elapsed between the rush of anticipatory marriages and the taking of the census left time enough for many infants married in haste to become widows for life  and the marked rise in the number of widows under ten years as compared with 1921  in spite of a decline in the proportion of widows on the whole  is probably significant of sorrows to come  particularly as  if widows under five years alone be examined  the 1921 figures are found to have more than doubled  It is likely that there was no marked lowering of the age of marriage until 1930  although as pointed out elsewhere an excess of males will tend in that direction it is evident  however  if only from the increase of married aged 0 3 where the possible influence of sorting methods is inoperative  that there has been a decided temporary fall in the age of marriage this fall is probably attributable almost entirely to anticipation of the Marriage Kestraint Act                                 stated above tha t some attempt would be made to distribute by been returned as unmarrim  It is assumed that in view of the extraordinary rush to get children married before the operation of the Sarda Act  and of the large number of married who have undoubtedly been returned as unmarried  it is justifiable to calculate for indi  idual coimnunities on the mean ratio of married females found  although for the total ratio for all communities the lowest recorded proportion of married females to males has been taken  Now the mean of the highest and lowest recorded Muslim ratios of married Women to married men found from 1881 onwards is 1 018 married women to 1 000 married men  To     religion the 1 046 747 or so married girls under 14 who must have  make up  this  366 598 more married women are Number of males returned as married in excess required than have actually been returnof total of married females of the s ime comed  Similarly the mean Hindu ratio of miinitv  married women to married men found from Hindu 168 0ol 1881 onwards is 1 006  To make the number Muslims 134 067 Jain o69 of married women up to this ratio another 627 890 Hindu women should have been returned as married  The ratio between these figures for Hindus and Muslims corresponds nearly enough to the ratio between the actual excess numbers of married males returned by each community from India and Burma together when Burmese Muslims are excluded  Similarly 999 Jain and 4 716 Sikh females need to be transferred from unmarried to married to raise their ratios respectively to the mean of the highest and lowest possible figures since 1881  This accounts for all but 46 544 of the minimum numbers required  and this must be left to be accounted for by the other communities or by still higher ratios  for it is not impossible but that the actual ratios of married females to married males are even higher than those assumed  If the additional numbers of married females ratio  Marriage

separate age groups for females shows that little more than one per cent  of survivors escape marriage  as compared for instance to about 26% in Northern Ireland  and by the age of 15 years nearly 40% have been married and one in every hundred is already a widow  By the age of 20 almost 85% have been married  3% being widowed  as compared to only 45% of males married by that age  In the next ten years the maximum extent of marriage is reached  nearly 98% of females having been married by the age of 30 and more than a tenth part of them already widowed  while of males 86% have been married  By 50 years more than half the female population of that age are already widows  though only 15% of the males of that age are widowed  and of females over 70 years more than 85% are widows  although less than 40% of males over 70 are widowers  In Northern Ireland 48% of women aged 65 and over or 62% of those aged 75 and over are widows  and of males over 65 over 29% are widowers  The tremendous

there is every reason to suppose that infant marriage in their case is an acquired habit  as it is not common to the Austroasiatic tribes  though it is probablv more natural to Kunbis than it is to Rajputs                                96  It is hardly necessary to point out that marriage as found and returned by an Indian census is not to be understood in the sense of marriage as returned in an European census  in which effective cohabitation of man and wife is a normal assumption  The practice of child marriage involves as a necessary corollary some postponement of effective maniage  and in the case of ^lu slims and of the majority of Hindus prepuberty consummation is not practised  though the prevailing Hindu custom certainly involves consummation at a very eariv date thereOn the other hand it is not accurate to state  though the statement is freafter  quently met  that the Hindu child marriage is merely an “ irrevocable betrothal ”  Apart from the fact that this expression is a contradiction in terms  for betrothal implies the possibility of breaking a troth which has only a moral obligation as its  M22CC  „ 9  Interpretatloii of “ Married”   \fCHAPTEK VI   226   CIVIL CONDITION   sanction  there exists no necessity in the case of the Hindu marriage for any further ceremony to cement the union  which also remains valid and final in the case of the  whereas completion by a subsequent ceremony would be mere betrothal  It is true that a further ceremony is frequently performed either when the wife is taken to her husband’s house or as a preliminary The to consummation  but such ceremonies are neither universal nor essential  Age of Consent Committee’s report has made this quite clear thus  in section 159  the   ractice of yaoiia  according to which the girl  wife is not sent to the husband’s family till some time after marriage  and generally after puberty  does not prevail in Bengal  with the result that soon after marriage  at any age  the girl lives with her husband and consummation invariably follows on attainment of puberty ”  Again  section 54  ’the custom of gaona obtains in the Punjab to a fair but is fast disappearing  and in any case the period which elapses extent between marriage and gao ta is becoming shorter and shorter ” Again in Assam  section 145    garbJiadhan is still mostly practised  It takes place soon after puberty and precedes consummation  Amongst some educated people it is falling In the case of widowers remarrying ” the ceremony is almost ininto disuse  bridegroom’s  death   essential to a     section 41  variably ignored Again  writing of India generally  section 227  “ There is a growing tendency everywhere to drop this practice  gaona  garbhadhan doli  rukhsati  etc   It is falling into disuse more and and none of the ceremonies are any protection to unions before 16 ” Finally in seciion  38 J the Committee conclude that   the practice of gaona  garhhadhana or similar con summation ceremonies does not obtain throughout India and  dwiragaman   more  where  er it existed once it is fast dying out Were the practice ol gaona or garbhadhana the most important part of the marriage ceremony it is possible that a return of married miglit Ix  made to coincide with one of efiective marriage  but as these ceremonies are neither essential to marriage nor its invariable concomitant it is obviously quite impossible to make their completion the test of a marriage for census p urposes  and marriage in these statistics can only be interpreted subject to the reservation that it is not ordinarily effective before puberty  and under the age of 1 5 years can probably be ignored  as far as the purely statistical consideration of the propagation of the species is concerned  Infant Marriage   97 To say that in one aspect marriages before the age of 15 can be ignored is not of course to suggest that child marriage is of no demographical importance  Its bearing on tlie population que stion has already been considered in the two precedThe map below shows roughly the prevalence of the custom ing chapters  of child marriage  for though it cannot attempt to take into account the number of married children ret imned at the census as unmarried  it must be recognised that infant marriage on the scale that preceded the Sarda Act at this census was of an abnormal nature and is hardly consistent with the steady improvement in the age of marriage that has taken place during the past 50 years ’  It is perhaps worth observing that this distribution suggests a correlation with the brachveephalic non Arnienoid Aljune element in the population of India  and it may be  observed that according to Vambtry  quoted by Westermarck  History oj Human Marriage  1901  page 214    all peoples of the Turkish stock are in the habit of betrothing babies The racial connection between Tajik and Indian brachvcephalic stock is indicated in Chapter XII  and a probable connection with Euss ia also pointed out  It may therefore be observed liere that at the end of the last century  1867 75  Rus sia was the only country in Europe where marriage approached the universality of mairiage in India  68 31% of persons being married  and the only country where the marriage age was anything like so young  57 27% of married women being under the age of 20  Hungary being the next with 3516%  Various views have b  en held as to the origin of the custom of child marriage  It seems never to have extended to the Malabar coast and is not nearly so prevalent in the extreme south   along the east coast  or in the north west as in the west in Bengal and in the Heccan  Clcarly it is very ancient and the suggestion that attributes it to the Muslim invasions is not even momentarily entertainable Megasthenes presumably refers to the practice when he records that the girls of the Pandaian kingdom bear children at the age of seven  adding that they are old at 40  Risley regards the custom as due primarily to hjyergamy which  by limiting the choice of bridegrooms  impels parents to marry off their girls at the earliest age possible  Whether hypergamy has or has not contributed to the establishment of the custom  it might equally well have been due  as it almost certainlv    is in  one  \fWIDOWHOOD   227  tribe in Assam  to a paucity of women and the necessity of making sure of a wife before someone else snapped her up  and not to a paucity of bridegrooms in a country where males exceed females  Gait regards infant marriage as the result of the  Aryan and Dra vidian and as a device to guard against pre marital communism  and this again is likely to have been a contributing factor  cf  infra chapter XII  page 457    i Iore weight however than was given by him seems due to the late Sir J  Campbell s opinion quoted on page 271 of the 1911 Census Eeport  Campbell’s opinion was that early mamage was due to a belief in the danger of dying with unfulfilled wishes combined with the great wish of a Hindu As  stated this is probably the uuong way round  to marry and have children is the cause of the fear of dtfing unmarried  children liat e and marry The wish to  impact

Europe may be inferred from the lielief once current in England that maids who died unwed lead apes in hell ’  It vtould be rr sfi to say that this  superstition was the ‘  cause of early marriage  but it seems nic re than in obable that tlie underlying idea which imnutes blame to failure to marry and proiiagate is the same as that which enjoins fertilization at the earliest o  T   rtinnty   98   Infant marriage natiually involves infant mdowhood  a feature of no significance where remarriage is allowed  but of serious importance where it is not  It has already been pointed out that there is an excess of males in India generally and that this is likely to tend  when associated with child marriage  towards an increasing disparity between the ages of husband and wife if it does not actually tend towards prepuberty marriage of the latter  M22CC   Widows who can be remarried do not  Widowhood   \fCHAPTER VI   228   CIVIL CONDITION   complicate the position  but the existence of numbers of youthful widows who cannot must accentuate this tendency  In the case of older widows it is obvious that their numbers will afiect the population question little once the reproductive ages are over  while in the case of widowers their loss to reproduction is governed only by their inability or disinclination to find wives  and at the reproductive ages their numbers at any given time are probably mainly tliose of males in the intermediate and temporary stage between bereavement and remarriage  In any case there is an excess of males and in consequence a solitary life is compulsory for a certain number and it makes little difference whether they are bachelors or widowers  The consideration of widowhood may therefore be confined to a consideration of its existence as a permanent bar to remarriage  It has ah eady i  een pointed out that the general ratio of vddowed females has decreased as compared with 1921  At that census there were 175 widows in every 1 000 females  a figure which had fallen in 1931 to 155  It is however only Jains and Hindus who place an effective ban on widow remarriage  and in both these communities the total ratio of widows has fallen Jain widows in 1931 were 253 per 1 000 females  but in 1931 onty 221   Similarly the 1921 figure of 191 widows in every 1 000 Hindu females has fallen to 169 in both these as in ail other communities the decrease mu ^fc be largely attributed to the absence of famine and pestilence during the past decade  Famine at anv rate seems definitely selective of males  On the orher liand  as already pointed out  there has

orgy of infant marriages involving in the course of a single year a most unfortunate mcrease in the number of child widows  If the reproductive ages alone be considered that is years 15 40  there has been a decrease m Jain widows since 1921  J   ’while  Widows aged 15 40 years   Hindu widows show an increase of less than 3%  less than a third that is of the rate of increase  in the population as a whole has already been suggested  Chapter V  1921  1931  para  81  aho^e that the ratio of reproductive females to males seems Jain       47 041 41 672 to be in direct relationship to the rate of Hindu    increase of the 5 817 781 6 981 096 community  so that any considerable luthe present decade in the   n       number of widows who cannot remarry is likely to reduce the proportion borne bv the Hmdu and Jam commumties to the population as a whole  if not in 1941 then certainly in 1951  so that from one point of view at least reform in the direction of widow remarriage of much more intensity than has been waged hitherto would It  •  \f   THE CHILD MARRIAGE RESTRAINT ACT  1930     229  seem to be indicated in tbeir own interests  as well as in those of the Sarda Act widows  on the part of Hindus in general  It has already been suggested that the caste system leads to the production of an excess of males that the excess exists It seems also an unavoidable conclusion that an is in any case incontrovertible  excess of males must tend to lower the age of marriage for females since the number The ban on widow remarriage of mature females will not be enough to go round  must accentuate the evils of this vicious circle as well as contributing very largely to excessive disparity in the ages of married couples where a widower remarries  a disparity which is apt to begin in unhappiness and conclude in sterility  for marriages of this kind are undoubtedly less fertile than those between persons of more equal ages  It is not without significance that the Census Commissioner of Baroda    State records that there is a “ Growing consciousness of the fact that remarriage is becoming a social necessity in places in which Gujarat  The 1911 Report mentioned a number of petitions from the Government of the State was actually requested to make remarriage of widows compulsory the disgrmitled bachelors reco  mted their woes in these petitions owing to the fewness of virgin brides in their castes  The local Arya Samaj in recent years has attempted to popularise the idea of remarriage of widows amongst higher castes  A permissive Act for the remarriage of    widows has been in existence for many years and yet very few persons amongst the higher castes have so far taken advantage of it  Census Committees report very little change in the general attitude of the higher castes  The Porwads in South Gujarat however are understood to have given a general permit to the widows to remarry Similarly the Census Superintendent in Eajputana points out that for every 256 potential bridegrooms in Rajputana there exist at present only 162 potential brides  and if the latter are not maiTied till they are 15 years old many males will reach 20  years unmarried   He writes     “ From 15 30  ages at which males contemplate or achieve marriage  there are 46 unmarried  males per 1 000 persons  while there are only 4 immarried females at similar ages   It therefore  follows that these 46 males must arrange marriages with girls who are aged from 5 10 and from 10 15 of whom there are 82  Observing these proportionate figures the approximate number of girls that have reached the age of  14 is 11 while boys of 18  19 and 20 may be assessed as 30   It looks therefore as if the discrepancy of 4 years fixed by the Sarda Act of 14 for females and 18 for males is for the present insufficient in practice and that if the provisions of the Act are rigidly complied with  the age of marriage for males will automatically rise to 21 23 for some years to come for want of sufficient girls who have reached the age of at least 14 ”   In short the course indicated by the census figures for Hindus is to raise the age for ^Muslims to relieve the rigours of maternity and the ban on widow remarriage of purdah when combined with penury and to raise likewise the age of maternity at any rate in those parts of India where Muslims practise infant marriage  It is not suggested that Hindus and Muslims are alone concerned in these matters  but it is they who constitute the vast bulk of the population of India jiroper  and it is their progeny that will determine the quahty of future generations     99 As a matter of fact the last three or four years of the decade under review have been particularly marked by social movements and legislation bearing on the marital condition of the people and therefore destined ultimately to affect that side of social life vdth the census returns for which this chapter is concerned  Dewan Bahadur Harbilas Sarda’s bill to prohibit  in the case of Hindus only  the marriage of girls under the age of 12 and boys under the age of 15 was first debated in the Legislative Assembly on September 1 5th  1927  and was then referred to a select committee by which it was converted to a penal measure apphcable to all communities  The Act  as passed in its final form as the Child Marriage Restraint Act on 28th September 1929  provided penalties for the solemnization of marriages of male children under 18 and of female children under 14 years of age  but did not invalidate marriages made in contravention of its provisions  It was to take effect from April 1st  1930  and it was this interval between the date when the Act was passed and the date on which it came into force which was very largely responsible for the enormous increase in the numbers of those married below the age of ten years  This period was natm ally an opportunity for a campaign against the Act by those who regarded it as objectionable  The opposition of a conservative section of orthodox Hindus was natural  and the objection was of course based on rehgious grounds  though all Brahmans  e ff   the Nambudris  do not practise prepuberty marriage and those who do not have not thereby lost    M22CC  The ChUd  Marriage Restraint Act  1930   \f   CHAPTER  T  230      CIVIL COKDITION   Generally speaking  the Act met ivith wide approval among educated in social relorm  and advantage was taken of the great Kumbh   iela at Allahabad in February just before the Act was to become operative to undertake propaganda on its behalf  though some of the orthodox resented the distribution of vernacidar translations of the Act and the Sanatan Dharnia In Poona a Yajurvediya Brahman sabha Sabha organised a demonstration  adopted resolutions making it obligatory on members of their eommumty to Rather refrain from divulging marriages made in contravention of the new law  an unlocked for opposition to the Act came from a section of the i Iuslim community based apparently on the arguments that any act controlling the age of marriage must ipso facto be an encroachment on the authority of the Shariat  and that the Quran itself  at any rate by imphcation  provided for child marriages in certain cases  The possibility of prepuberty marriage certainly seems to be implied in the Book Divorce where three months are prescribed as the term ‘‘ who have within wAich a divorce shall not become absolute in the case of wives On the other hand it has been stated that consumnot yet had their courses mation before pubert   is forbidden by the Shariat  and in any case a female married as a minor is entitled to repudiate the marriage on attaining majority  and the position of the IMushm objectors to the Act seemed to be that no restriction was required in their case and that any legislation made a precedent for inter Other jiuslims hold marriage to be a civil ference with their religious law  contract  and all agree that prepuberty consummation is not practised  but it seems clear that in the North West Frontier Province  as in east Bengal and in Assam  prepuberty betrothal has the sanctity of marriage in the eyes of custom  while the actual returns of Muslim marriages at this census have suggested to at it is also probable that through close least one census superintendent that association with their Hindu neighbours they  that is Mushms  are gradually assimilating more and more the social customs of the major community ” As it was  a illusUni conference was held under the auspices of the “ Committee for the Protection of Religion ” and passed a resolution calhng for a campaign of civil disobedience against the Act and urging Jiuslims to celebrate marriages in contravention of it  as if they were desirous to prove the Act unnecessary by Similar propaganda led creating neiv conditions in whiih it would be needed  to Muslim processions and a hartal in Peshawar but failed to bring about a large number of marriages before April 1st as its promoters had intended  and a somewhat artificial nature is suggested for the ^Muslim propaganda by the fact that in Baroda State an Infant Marriage Prevention Act had operated since 1904  without any opposition for almost a generation  although at any rate one Hindu community there had obtained exemption from the Act s prohsions  their status   Hindus interested  ‘  ’  INIeanwhile there took place all over India a rush to marry off minor children Gujarat and Bengal seem to have been particubefore the Act became effective  larly active in this respect  but otlier parts of India w’ere not far behind  Libertif  13th March  1930   with substantial accuracy in spite of some what hyperbohcal wording  thus described the state of affairs in March 1930    “  A matrimonial wave i  just passing over the country   to groom in the cradle      The Sarda Act is coming  Bride in embryo is being mated  into force and the pig tailed prmdits have  sanctioned rather sanctitied juvenile unions to stave off perdition  Poor girl just learning to suck the feeding bottle is being carried over to the wedding bower  Urchins are being snatched from the arms of their playmates to don the garb of a groom  As an emergency measure the ela stie pundits have issuetl an edict whereby they ha^ e certified the month of Chaitra to be the pioper sea son for matrimonial alliaiues our pundits  have extended the limit tiii s vear           We are sure before the 1st of April come in there  will hardly be left a single unraarrierl man or woman in India ”   Two thousand child marriage contracts had been reported from Gujarat as pievious November  and demands for dowries iver  said to have exorbitant and the businesses of monev leiiders brisk  Amono the Kadva Kuiibis of Gujarat  however  the  spate of marriage was partly attributed to the custom by w hich marriages are celebrated onlv ” when the goddess speaks ”  an occasion which is determined in the temple of Umia Mata at Unjha by lots drawTi b  Biahman priests and astrolog  “r s after worship with the tw^o headmen of that place in the Meiisana district the Baroda State  Consequentlv marriace opportunities for this section of the community occur only at intervals early as tlie  become  and   \fTHE CHILD MAEKIAGE RESTEAINT ACT  1930  possibly as rarely as once before the census of 1911   231  years  One such occasion occurred just The total population of Kadva Kunbis was 269 348  in twelve  according to the census of 1921 and in 1931 there were 219 161 in Baro da alone   The rush of ma rriages in Gujarat went on in December  and 1 000 wei e reported to have taken place in Surat on Deceniher 12th alone  while all the towns in that district were festive with marriage processions  music and illuminations  the great majority of which marriages undoubtedly took place in anticipation of the operation of the restricting Act  Similar scenes were enacted in Bengal in the following February and March particularly in the districts of Hughli  Bankura  Dinajpur  Nadia  Dacca and Chittagong  In Bakarganj the monthly average of minor marriages registered during 1921 to 1929 was 305  In the four months from January to April  1930   the numbers registered were I espectively 419  1 320  8 782 and 4 452 ”  and these figures refer of course to IMuslim marriages only  In Bankura child marriages were reported to be taking place at the rate of 1000 a day on propitious days in February in Dinajpur some  10 000 marriages were reputed to have taken place  mostly in order to anticipate the Act  between the in the Chuadanga subdivision of middle of January and the middle of March Nadia some 4 000 marriages were reported to have involved difficulties in the engagement of musicians  palanquin bearers  and even of motor cars and  buses  and to have sent up the prices of fish  curds and sweetmeats to exorbitant figures  One account from Bengal states that moneyas was the case also in Chittagong  lenders and others who stood to profit by the celebration of marriages circulated a rumour that the Act prohibited any marriage’s taking place for the space of 14 years  A similar rush of marriages was reported from Allahabad at the end of the auspicious season for marriages in March  as also from Manbhum in Bihar  In the Tamil districts of southern India himdreds of child marriages were likewise reported in March  and it was reported from Madura that on March 12th and 15th  days found propitious by the astrologers  200 vakils of that town “ married off their children  practically all of whom were within the ages of 6 to 10”  In Bombay there was a similar rush of marriages in Slarch these were mostly Hindus  but in Goalpara in Assam both Hindus and Muslims celebrated a rush of marriages to an extent sufficient to run up the price of many commodities  while towards the end of March the Marriage Registration offices in the  Munshiganj sub di  ision of Dacca in Bengal were registering 100 marriages a day among Muslims  In Sind likeivise Muslims as well as Hindus hurried on marriages to forestall the Act  In Larkana town alone 300 pairs of infants were reported to have had their marriages arranged for March  while in the Larkana and Upper Sind Frontier districts the number of marriages taking place was so great that difficulty was experienced in getting the services not only of musicians  it was said  but even of priests  In many cases  of course  the children married in all this haste were the merest infants  Apart from vague descriptions of the children married as “ mere babes ”  Gujarat  or as “ aged only a few months ”  Dhanbad  many specific cases were reported of marriages in which the bridegroom and bride were respectively  to give some of the actual instances  25 and two and a half years  Bankura   seven years and three years old  Calcutta   two years old and twenty one days  Serajganj   three years old and ten days old  Brahmanbaria   four years and three years  Sind   while in another Sind case a Muslim gentleman of position was reported to have married a yet unweaned son to a girl of 4 years  and on March 25th in another province the sixyear old son of an influential Muslim nobleman was married to the four year old daughter of a very prominent j udge           Not unnaturally this rush of hasty mairiages involved unforeseen consequences  Criminal cases followed marriages hurried though without the consent of parents or others in which the caste of an emergency bridegroom had been misrepresented  a deluded Kayastha in Bengal  for instance  marrying his daughter to a Napit  Other sucli marriages had to be stopped by injunctions  and in one case in Nasik the court interfered to prevent the marriage of a Brahman girl of 10 to a deformed Her fatlier s excuse was that the Act would cripple nearly four times her age  the Shastras to keep Ins daughter unmarried till was against force  it

tliis case but by another earlier in the year  also in Bombay  Youth Leayii   interfered to obtain an injunction against the second marriage of a boy of 12 who was sickly and whose first wife was alive  In this Case iiowever the marriage was carried through outside British territory  after wLicIi rhe boy died leaving two child widows  Of a difierent sort were the consequences of the pre Sarda Act marriages in Assam  where the expenses incurred on these marriag  s Ijy IMuslim immigi ants from Maimansingh were followed by very low prices for jr te and paddy and thus materially contributed to agricultural distress and to the con sequent necessity for the distribution of loans  Similarly in Bengal anxiety to forestall the Act is reputed to have led to reckless borrowing on a large scale  with fantastic rates of interest ” which are reported to have monnted as high as 78% in Bogra District  In Broach district in Bombay the President of the District Pongress Committee publicly complained that the people Vv ere too engrossed in marrying to care for political  meetings   irLclicatL d  in vrliidi the  In ^act marriages did iiot stop when the Act came into force  but were celebrated    anicularly by iMuslims  by way of protest and challenge  On April 4th a congr^ gaiicn of some 12 000 iMuslims  for instance  were assembled at the Jama Masjid in Delhi to witness the marriage of a boy of 13 to a girl of 9  and the District Magistrate was then petitioned to prosecute all concerned  Similar marriages were celebrated h   iMuslims in Multan  and orthodox Hindus as well as Muslims continued to protest against the Act and to advocate defiance  On the other hand supporters of the Act were active in protest against any rumour of its amendment and a representation to the same efiect was made to H  E  the Viceroy by an influential body of MusUm ladies  while the support given by the leading Indian Christians to the Act brought out an aspect of the situation unfamiliar to many  in that it indicated the retention of purely secular marriage among the rural Christian community on account of the fact that early marriage could not be celebrated under the Christian Marriage Act  This retention of secular marriage after conversion is familiar enough in the case of many hill tribes on account of the difficulty of obtaining divorce in the case of marriages under the Christian Marriage Act  but in their case the question of age does not lead to any difficulty as they mostly practise adult marriage  In spite of educated support  however  the agitation against the Act resulted in Mr  Surpat Singh’s motion in July 1930 to amend the Act so as to permit of the marriage of persons below the specified ages on the prcduction by such person s guardians of the certificate of a Civil Court of its satisfaction that the marriage should be permitted for family reasons or on conscientious grounds  Other amending bills have since been introduced either to repeal the Act altogether or to exempt from its operation communities in which post puberty marriage is forbidden by their religious usages or customs  but none of them have got further than that stage  Meanwhile corresponding legislation has been passed in a number of Indian States including Kashmir and Baroda  Mysore  which had an Infant Marriage Prevention Regulation  forbidding the marriage of girls under eight years  as early as 1894  introduced a bill in 1931 making punishable marriages ^elow the ages prescribed in the Sarda Act but providing for the reduction of the age for special reasons to 12 in the case of girls  under the orders of the District Magistrate and on condition that consummation should not take place till after the age of 14  At the time ^f writing this hill has not yet become law  but a law has been enacted in Jammu and Kashmir  and the pre existing law in Baroda was at once brought into conformity with that in British India  In the Idar State the Act proposed by the State Council likewise prescribes the ages of 18 and 14 and contauis the additional proviso that a man over 45 years of age shall not marry a woman of less than half his age  On the other hand the Kadva Kunbis  whose custom of observing periodic marriage occasions has ahead   been mentioned  are to be permitted to continue to celebrate under age marriages provided consummation is postponed  The Baroda Government on the contrary  which had an Infant Man iage Prevention Act in 1904  and which had since 1922 exempted the Kadva Kunbis from its application  withdrew that privilege in the 1930 amendment  and at the same time stiffened the Act by invalidating all marriages below the ages of 8 and 6 in the cases of boys and girls respectively  and made the parties responsible for all marriages under 16 or 14  as the case might be  punishable by imprisonment as well as by tine  As a matter of fact the Kadva Kunbis cannot be regarded as suffering very severe hardship under any child marriage restraint act   \fTHE CHILD ILiRRlAGE RESTRAINT ACT  1930     233  as they can fulfil their obhgation to the goddess by marr 3dng the child to a bunch of flowers which is afterwards thrown away  when the child can be remarried by the natra form used for the widowed  Apart from this particular group of Kimbis  the Kunbi  Kurmi or Kurmikshattriya group generally have been somewhat conspicuous for the practice of infant marriage this is probably an ancient charac   teristic  but  may possibly be now a days a factor in their campaign of  social  scansion   The instructions of the Government of India were that the provisions of the Child Marriage Eestraint Act should on coming into operation be administered with due care and discretion  and the cry was raised that the Act was intended to be a dead letter  It is of course obvious from the nature of the Act that nothing will come of it if no one bothers to prosecute  a duty which has been deliberately left to the private citizen the Census Superintendent for Bihar and Grissa quotes number of correspondents who agree that the Act is ineffective in that province  a and the Census Superintendent of Assam describes it as quite inoperative in that province  and this perhaps is the general view of the functioning of the Act in most parts of India  for the Act depends for its success on the vigorous working of public opinion  The first conviction under the Act was reported from Lahore in July 1930  and up to February 1931  when the census took place  there had been thirtythree prosecutions  at least three of which related to Muslims and one to Christians  Since then not less than a score of convictions and more injunctions have served to show that the Act can operate successfully ivliere there are public associations or pi irate individuals prepared to deposit security and tahe up cases in which the law is being transgressed  Thus the Gujarat Social Reform Association has taken action in a number of cases including two in which men of 40 or 50 were to marry girls of 6  At the same time  the warning of the Age of Consent Committee  Report  Section It points out that the number of such 291  page 133  applies here with some force  institutions “ is so small and the places where they exist so few  that it will be a travesty of facts to suggest that these associations would serve the purpose of repcrting even grave cases of breaches of the law  The rural areas may be altogether wiped out of the map if all hope is concentrated on the maimer in which these associations will function ”  In one case dealt with by the courts in Noakhali in Bengal two brothers aged 50 and 45 were punished for marrying  in defiance of the Act  their two cousins age 4 and 2  They were Muslims and the intention was to obtain final control of the property and persons of the two children whose guardians they were  a motive which would apparently put the marriage in any case into the category of those banned in the rather obscure verse at the beginning of that book of the Quran called The Women ’  They were fined Rs  150 each  not an e xcessively severe penaltv  in ^iew of the fact that thev had presumablv effected their object  In a case in Madras a village munsiff who transgressed the Act was dismissed by the Collector but re instated with a warning by higher authorit    It is  however  still easy enough in many places to evade the Act entirely by celebrating a marriage outside British territory  and a specific instance may be quoted of parties in Ajmer who went to Kishengarh State to celebrate a marriage illegal in British India  This however seems to indicate that the law is something more than a mere dead letter  and that the unfortunate increase in the existing numbers of infants and children married and widowed at a tender age  which has been occasioned by the advantage taken by the orthodox to marry while an open season yet remained  may ultimately be compensated for by the numbers which will benefit from the future working of the Act  There is also hope that once the practice of prepnberty marriage ceases  if it does  there will be an automatic improvement in the position of the unfortunate father of daughters who must mider present conditions almost ruin himself financially in order to avoid the stigma of their growing up unmarried  In the Baroda State Council a bill has been moved to make it a punishable offence for a bridegroom or his guardians to ask for any remuneration as the price of his willingness to accept a girl as a bride  and the proposed penalty is a fine of Rs  509 or six months simple imprisonment or both  It is doubtful if it would be possible to enforce such a law  any more than the Sarda Act can be enforced if the public do not prosecute  but it “ professes the most noble sentiments ”        One point has to be borne in mind with regard to the marriage of girls and that that an excess of males  particularly when it is almost compulsory for men to have a son  since “ there is no heaven for a sonless man ”  is bound to lower the age is  \fCHAPTER VI   224   CIVIL CONDITION   Wlien there are not enough to go round it becomes a necessity to secure a girl while she is still young enough not to have been snapped up of marriage for females   by some one else  and  if as wo have suggested elsewhere  ride supra para  79  an excess of males is biologically inherent in the present caste system  a relaxation of that system will be necessary to increase the proportion of females to males and to remo  e the growing shortage of the former  which must  if it continue to increase  tend irresistib ly in the end towards making the early marriage of girls almost  compulsory  Widow Remarriage

permit the Hindu community to resort to divorce in certain circumstances was introduced in the Legislative Council of the Baroda State and received the  Gaekwar s assent in 1931   On the Malabar coast  owing to the prevalence of the taarnmalknthayam system  the position of women generally has been bettor than in anv other part The Xambudri Brahmans  however  follow the makhathayam of civilized India  the great majority of Xambudri women are condemned by ancient system and unmarried  to remain as only the eldest son in a Xambudri family marries custom own caste  his The others marry Xayar women with whom they hve a wife of in the form of union known as sambandham  easily dissoluble by either party  Legislation is now in progress to enable the younger brothers of a Xambudri family to contract marriages within their own caste and also to give legal recognition and binding effect to sambandham marriages  as was done in Cochin State by the Xayar Regulation of 1920   whether

inherit a moiety of undisposed selfacquired property left by the husband  By the customary law all responsibihty for the maintenance of the children lay with the Avoman’s family  and any property

orld when taken by itself  has possibly But it Avould be in the past been exploited by the Nambudris to their OAvn profit  as great an error to replace the marumakkaihayam system by the ordinary makkathayam one as to suppose that the former is either primitive  barbarous or in any way less respectable than the latter  although it is less Avidely distributed  On the contrary it seems likely that the niarmnakkathayam was the ancient and ciAuhsed system  which was replaced in most countries of southern Europe and southern Asia by the makkathayam imder the stress of conquest by a ruder people from the steppes of southern Russia  101  It is not possible to leave the subject of divorce Avuthout a reference to the Indian Christian Marriage Act  The Roman Cathohc Church while objecting strongly to the Indian Divorce Act as making it possible for Cathohcs to obtain dissolution of marriage  AA’hich is contrary to Canon LaAv  simultaneously objects to the fact that the laws goA’eming Christian marriage m ake no proAusion the Pauline priAulege ’  that is for the riglit of the Church for what is known as contracted before conversion  a practice that would require dissolve a marriage to of strictest control on the part the state to prevent abuses  as conversion the with the mere object of shaking ofi utilized indh iduals known to be been by has unwanted partners vuthout incurring the liability to maintain them  On the other hand the Act is criticised from the opposite side for making it possible for courts to hold  as they have done  AAUth reference to section 4 of the Act  that any marriage in which one or both the parties are Christians must be solemnized in one of the ways provided by section 5  from w hich it is held that no marriage can be contracted by a Christian except under the provisions of the Act  and that to perform or abet the performance of the marriage of a Christian conA’ert according to the rites of another faith is punishable under the Act   Inter Cacte Marrii^    ‘  The difficulty of marrying into another religion Avithout a change of creed one confined to Indian Christians  and until 1923 there Avas no law under which Hindus could contract a valid inter caste marriage except under the Special Marriage Act of 1872  Avhich invoK’ ed a declaration that the party to the ceremony was neither a Muslim nor a Hindu  In 1 91 0 a bill was brought to legalise marriages betw’een persons of different castes and different reUgions  but it failed  and the same fate befell another lull in 1919  to legalise inter caste marriages  In 1923 the bill referred to above was framed to legalise marriages between persons of different religions  as aa’cII a s different castes  but the opposition it met vith resulted in the exclusion of all communities other than Hindus  Sikhs  Jains and Buddhists  Recourse to this law  hoAveA’er  inA ohes to a Hindu the loss of his personal laAv  and he not only loses his joint family membership  his right to

autumn of 1927 that the Sarda Bill was first debated in the Assembly  the Council of State discussed the motion of a IMadras membei  for the preA’ention of the dedication of girls as devadasis in Hindu temples on the ground that such dedication ineA’itably entailed a life of prostitution for the girl so dediThe motion was opposed by the Law 3Iember on the ground that the cated  alleged consequences of such dedication AA^ere not ineAutable and that  in so far as they might be  the case Avas coAered by Act XVIII of 1924  which amended Sections 372 and 375 of the Indian Penal Code so as to extend their scope to cover cases of girls dedicated to Hindu temples  The motion was Avdthch’awn on Government’s undertaking that if a bill AA ere introduced it should be circulated for opinion  In November of the same year the Madras LegislatiA^e Council passed unanimously a resolution recommending Government to undertake prec’entiA^e  Oevadatic   \f236  CHAPTER VI      CIVIL CONDITION   legislation  and on that principle the Council legislated for the enfranchisement of  inamholding Devadasis  that is of dedicated women holding land in virtue of temple service  Dr  Muthulaksmi Reddi brought a bill in the Madras Council in 1930  to prohibit the performance of the dedicatory ceremony in any Hindu temple and to enable dedicated women to contract a legal marriage  and in the same year Mr  Jayakar gave notice of his intention to introduce in the Legislative Assembly a similar bill to be of general application  but the bill was not introduced  Early in 1930  the Chief of Sawantwadi raised the minimum age of dedication to 18 in that State  and in July of the same year the Maharani of Travancore abolished dedication in the temples maintained by the Government of her State  The Mysore Government had prohibited the dedication of girls in State controlled temples as early as 1910  The question of Devadasis is introduced here because it clearly has a bearing on the census returns of marital condition  It is probable that the great majority of such women return themselves as married  regarding themselves as married to the god  and it has also to be borne in mind that a life of immorality is not necessarily the consequence of dedication  In several castes in Madras  particularly in Bellary and the neighbourhood  it is the practice  if a male heir be wanting  to dedicate a daughter in the temple  Thenceforward she becomes by established custom the heir to her parents’ property and can perform their funeral rites as if she were a son  She takes to herself a mate of her own selection of any equal or higher caste  but continues to live in her father’s house  and her children take his name and belong to his family and not to their father s  If she has a son he inherits the property and continnes the fa mil y^ while if she have a daughter only the daughter will in her turn become a bamin and renew the attempt  No social stigma attaches to her  but rather the contrary  for her presence at weddings is auspicious  j^robably because she cannot become a widow  Clearly no immorality is inherent in this custom  which is merely a method of temporarily reverting to the ^narmnaMathayam system when the family lacks a male heir and the mahhathayam system proves irksome or inadequate   As has been already suggested  it is probable that a matrilineal system formerly obtained throughout Dravidian speaking India  as it did in southern Europe  Asia Minor  Egypt and Mesopotamia   The western Asiatic affinities of the devadasi custom of the Tamilnad  for it is perhaps only there that the custom is still general  are clear enough  Apart from the familiar account of Herodotus of the offering made by women of their chastity in the temple of Mylitta at Babylon  a reference to which custom is made also in the 43rd verse of the Epistle of Jeremy in the Book of the apocryphal Prophet Baruch  Lucian mentions the same custom at Byblusin Phoenicin there the goddp ss of a temple  connected at a very early date with Egvpt  was a fish from the waist downwards and had by her temple a pool of sacred tish with a stone chattri in its midst  and a woman had the alternative of shaving her head and offering her hair  r   pp  398  411 infra  instead of her chastity  Lucian as a matter of fact puts it the other way “ the women who do not chuse to be shaved are obliged in lieu of it to expose their persons  and submit to the embraces of  strangers in the public market j lace for hire  during the space of one whole day the money arising from it is consecrated to the service of the goddess and expended on a sacrifice to her ”  Lucian  On the Syrian Goddess  tr  Franklin   Hair was offered by Argive maidens to Athene before marriage  and those of Megara offered clippings of their hair at the tomb of Iphinoe in Delos both youths and maidens offered their hair before marriage at a tomb of corn maidens in the aanctuary of Artemis hair was polled and offered to the goddess of health at Titane near Corinth whose image was “ swathed in strips of Babylonish raiment ”  and it is still shorn and offered to the Holy Virgin at Tenos as a thanksgiving for recovery from sickness at Troezen every maiden before marriage dedicated a lock of her liair  in this case to a male deity  in the temple of Hippolytus  In all these cases  with the poji sible exception of that of the goddess of health  the association seems to be between hair and fertility of the soil and of the body  and is probably the same association in India that makes the Abbe Dubois note on the commonness of the offering of hair in temples by men and women in fulfilment of a vow   People of India  III  iii   This practice obtains now even at the darga of the Mirgan Sahib at Kagore in Tanjore district  where there is a tank  such as those commonly found                   For a map showing the ancient sites here mentioned see the last page of ch  XII   \f237  DEVADASIS   at Hindu temples  to which Hindu women come to bathe who have vowed their The element of a vow seems also to have entered into the hair to the Mus lim Saint  practice of sacred prostitution at Comana in Pontus  where Strabo records that people assembled on account of vows made to sacrifice to the goddess  describing the place as “ full of women trafficking in their persons  the most of them that is to the moon goddess  Similar customs were observed at the sacred Phoenician colony of Sicca on the north African coast at Heliopolis in Syria likewise women prostituted themselves from religious motives  and in Armenia  at the temple of Anaitis  Strabo tells us that “ they dedicate male and female slaves  a fact in no way remarkable  but finther the most illustrious of the people dedicate their virgin daughters  who according to custom prostitute themselves for a long period in the service of the goddess and are afterwards given in marriage ”  Similarly it appears that in some Indian temples it is usual for a devadasi to serve for a period in the temple and thereafter be kept as a concubine outside  Consecrated hetaerae were associated with the worship of Aphrodite at Corinth  and an inscription from Tralles in Lydia is referred to by Frazer which shows that the custom obtained in Asia Minor as late as the second century A  D  “ It records ”  he says  “ of a certain woman  Aurelia Aemilia by name  not only that she herself served the god in the capacity of a harlot at his express command  but that her mother and female ancestors had done the same before her ”  Strabo records a practice of dedicating girls in the temple of Ammon in Egypt not dissimilar to that in Armenia except that in the case of Ammon the deity was male and the dedicated girls  when given to a human husband after This practice of serving their term as the wives of the god  were mourned as dead  marriage to the god appears again  but at an earlier date  in Mesopotamia  Marduk and the Sun god Shamash both had female votaries who were married to them and who had human  children and the word used for these dedicated women was the same as the Hebrew word for a temple harlot  It is hardly necessary to point out that the devadasi is likewise married to the god  but may have children by men  Dedications of virility were also made in the temple of the Syrian goddess  whose priests were eunuchs who had dedicated themselves by castration  and it is possible that an Indian snrvival of the same cult is to be seen in the dedication of natural eunuchs or otherwise deformed males to the goddess Huligamma  and in the cult of the goddess Chatushringi  whose temple on a hill near Poona is served by men  said to be natural eunuchs  who dress in women’s clothes and spend their lives begging and worshipping the goddess  at whose temple they collect in large numIn the Deccan  besides the girls dedicated to the bers to celebrate the Dasehra  god Khandoba as murli  boys  vaghyd  are also dedicated and are brought up as temple servants and mendicants  This god Khandoba is worshipped at the Dasehra in association with Ekavira  who is definitely a fertility goddess worshipped during the Dasehra in Maratha house holds in little Gardens of Adonis  In any case the general parallel between the practice in southern India and that in Syria and Asia Minor is too close to be fortuitous  and offers another link between Dravidian India and the eastern Mediterranean  cf  Chapters X  XII   It is true that the Asian deity was more often a goddess and that in India a god is served  but there is much other evidence to indicate that in India as in Greece and Italyt and as also in Asia Minor  the mother goddess and a matrilineal system preceded a change to the patrilineal system of nordic or proto nordic It is  of course  impossible to dissociate the custom bv which all invaders  worshippers propitiate the deity once in their lives by an offering of their chastity from that of dedicating some individuals to do it for a period of Indeed the custom alluded to above of dedicating a daughter as a their lives  hasavi for the sake of reA iving the otherwise inoperative marumaklm^haijam inheritance rather suggests that the practice of dedication in one form or another  real or symbolic  may have at one time been the universal concomitant of the matrilineal system in India as in Asia Minor or in Cyprus  It is possible that the taliketta ceremony on the Malabar coast points in the same direction the Brahman explanation of it as a purificatory sacrament  Iyer  Coc a’a Tribes and Castes     XL       Kai Tr f 9o    aXkoi Be kut’ ev^vv dei rtves e jriBrjfiova i  OwrLa^ re eVtTeXoOi Te  rrjd co ywaiKcov epjat^ojjievutv afro rov aiofiaros  3 v

antagonistic  At any rate the custom of dedication prevailed as far west as Chorus  where there was a custom  Herodotus  mentions it  similar to that of Babylon  and on the African coast to Sicca Veneria and probably to Carthage herself  The Cyprian shrines were connected in form in respect of their horn and pillar cult with Crete and Mycenae  while the cones which were the emblem of the goddess at Byblus and other places in Asia Minor have been found in the most ancient sanctuary of Cyprus and as far west as Malta  There can be no doubt but that the custom of consecrated prostitution originates in a commerce regarded as essentially necessary to ensure that life should be propagated and that the earth should fructify  and in a further reference below  Chapter XI  page 416  the significance of the participation of a stranger is suggested  According to Bernier the virgin married to Vishnu at Puri consulted the god as to the abundance of the coming harvest  an association which is most significant  Marco Polo in giving an account of the custom of prostitution to strangers in the province of Kamul tells us how  it was indignantly prohibited by the Emperor of China  The order was obeyed for three years and then rescinded  as it was found that the land became barren in consequence and the earth no longer brought forth her fruit  in due season   \fSUBSIDIARY TABLES

APPENDIX TO CHAPTEE VI   A  C   Turner    Some notes on marriage in the United Provinces   A general tendency is noticeable among the more educated Hindus to omit the less important ceremonies in connexion with marriage  and to spend less on the celebration of marriages and other social events  This is largely economic  For instance  the thauna  third and final visit of husband to bring his bride from her house to his  and ala ckala  after which the wife is free to go backwards and forwards between her parents’ house and her husband’s without cere   mony  are often omitted by Hindus and those Muslims who formerly practised them now pay less observance to manjha or hona haifhana  the segregation of the bride from her parents and    home after  elders just prior to the wedding   chauthi  the first visit of the wife to her parents’  the niMsati and her subsequent return with her husband   and chala   The commonest form of  marriage among ordinary castes is paupujia or dola  This differs from the charhawa marriage of the higher castes only in that the bride and her people come to the bridegroom’s house for the biyah rites to be performed instead of those rites taking place at the bride’s home  The bridegroom goes to fetch her at the gauna   A variation of the paupujia custom occurs in the case of certain Vaishya sub castes  After the marriage has been arranged and the date fixed the bride’s parents go to the town or village where the bridegroom’s family lives  take a house on rent and aU the ceremonies are performed in this rented house instead of at the bride’s home  This variation is known as utha biyah  Eajbhat Umars  a sub class of the Umar Vaishyas  practise yet another variation  When the marriage has been settled the bridegroom’s father with some of his relatives visit the bride’s home for 2 or 3 days  Then they depart with the bride to their home and all the pre marriage ceremonies which are normally carried out at her home are performed at the bridegroom’s  The bride’s people come 2 or 3 days before the marriage and stay at the bridegroom’s house and then the marriage takes place on the appointed day  This practice is  however  falhng into  disfavour   Ghar  Damadi   Qharjawai  Qharjamai   or  In paragraph 231 on page 220 of the 1911 Report Mr  Blunt refers to Beena marriage  Here the suitor goes to live with the girl’s family and works there  in a capacity which is part servant  part debtor  for a certain period before he marries her  Mr  Blunt gave two views as to its origin which wore not mutually exclusive and added “ At the present day  whatever the original object of the custom  it is used as a means of getting a wife without paying a dowry in cash or kind  It is restricted to poor people who work out the dowry in labour  Nominally intercourse is forbidden  the son in law in futuro gets maintenance  but has no claim on the father in law’s property  The custom is found among the Bhuiyar  Bind  Chero  Gha si ’a  Kharwar  Majhwar  Gond and Parahiya castes its usual name is ghar jawai gharjoiyan  or ghardamada  The normal period appears to he three years ” This practice  which has in it the elements of marriage by purchase  still continues among not only the above There is no fixed period of castes but also among Kuchbandia Kanjars and Kalabaz Nats  Among Brijbasi Gual Nats of Sahaswan tahsil in district Budaun  a bridegroom marservice  ried in this way cannot leave his father in law’s house even after serving the agreed period and marrying the girl but must stay and serve after marriage so long as his wife’s parents are If he wi «hes to leave earlier he must pay the parents a bride price which is then fixed alive  by the tribal jmnchnyut  at all events  connubial     But this practice in a somewhat modified form is now to be found among most Hindu Formerly a man who lived in his father in law’s house or in  castes and even among Muslims   husband’s house wa s very much looked down upon  so much so that there was a  his sister’s  more forcible Hindi proverb than that quoted by Mr  Blunt at the foot of page 220  which ran “ Kutta pale so l utta  sas ghar jnniai aur bahin ghar bhai ”  he who tames a dog is a dog  a  man living in his mother in law’s house and a man living  where his sister is married are the other two dogs   There has  however  been a perceptible change in the social outlook and although such arrangements are still not regarded with much favour the three dogs are not treated with quite such contempt as in the past  Almost everywhere some cases are met with of a son inlaw going to live with his wife s parents  under the following circumstances ‘  ’      i   when the girl s father is well to do and has no sons   i i    Hi         when the girl s family is very poor and wants the help or a strong man and    when the son in law is a poor man and cannot pay a dower   If the girl s family In  such cases the man usually settles permanently with his in laws ’  is well to do and The 1 ridegioom is in fair circum stances the bride’s father often has to pay    large sum to the latter to induce him to accejit the stigma attaching to a ghar jau ai

 It is therefore most common among the lower castes Brahmans  Rajputs and Vaishyas would only contract such an alliance if they were very poor men and the widow’s    possessions attractive   MarriH^  by  capture   Man iage by capture  is  non existent  thought as Mr  Blunt mentioned there are traces  of its past existence in some of the marriage rites   Quite dilierent in nature is the curious custom  observed by Goriyas of the Gorakhpur district  who appear to be the outcome of fusion between a sub caste of jVIallahs and a sub caste of Kahars   Before the rite of sendhurdan  marking the parting of the bride’s hair with red lead  is performed the bridegroom leaves the wedding party The bride in assumed umbrage and goes and sits on a roof erected specially for the purpose  “ marry her saying to lord  come and marry me  You bim him My entreats and goes to then  Marriage exchange  by  need do no work as I will work and earn money for you”  The bridegroom and bride then descend from the roof and the marriage proceeds  The origin of this peculiar rite is unknown In this province the practice is found in two forms  The first is adala badala  santa  ot golawat  in which form the son of one man marries the daughter This form is found of the other  and the second man’s son marries the first man’s daughter  chiefly among the ordinary castes such as Kuchband Kanjars  Gual Nats  Dharkars  Tarkihars  Chhipis  Khatiks  Gadarias  Barhais  Lohars  Kirrmis and Kahars  In some parts Sonars adopt Jains sometimes arrange such it  and it is quite common among Mathuria Chaube Brahmans  This form  however  is not popular and is often looked down upon  marriages   The more popular form is known as tigadda  or tiptha which is a triangular arrangement thus     A son     daughter  This arrangement is common everywhere among the ordinary castes and often among the higher  including Vaishyas   In the east of t ne province where Muslims are largely descendants  of converts from Hinduism who have retained many Hindu customs  they too practise the cus   tom  Polyandry   Divorce   Adoption   Polyandry is still practised among all classes and castes in Jaunsar Bawar  district Dehra Dun   A few of the more educated have taken to monogamy themselves but at the same time have no objection to giving a daughter in marriage to all the brothers of one family  The reason given by these folk is economic  Separate marriages of brothers may lead to division of the family property which when broken up would not suffice to maintain individual members of the family with their own separate establishments  That polyandry does not continue in Jaunsar Bawar entirely on account of the dearth of females is shown by the fact that many girls from there are married into the Punjab Chhuf  divorce  is practised in Jaunsar Bawar  A husband can at any time divorce his wife either verbally or in writing provided the next man who takes her to wife pays double the jeodhan  Divorces without serious reasons are  however  growing less comnton In Chakrata tahsil of Dehra Dun  Jaunsar Bawar  the bridegroom has to jtay a small sum to the bride’s father naje xihan  as ceremonial gift  which is intended to cover the expenses of the marriage  Under the Hindu law  a son may be adopted but not a daughter  Among Jogila Nats  Khalkhor Nats  reported from Budaun  and Kuchband Kanjars  however  the custom of adopting a daughter also exists   \fCHAPTER Vli  Infirmities  103 As in tie previous census the enumerators were instructed to record the lact for each individual who was found to be insane  deaf and dumb  blind of both eyes or suffering from corrosive lepro sy  They were also warned against recording as blind those who suffered from loss of the sight in one eye only  or as lepers jiersons who suffered from leucoderma  In Bengal blind of both eyes was defined as “ unThese instrucable to count the fingers of a hand held up at one yard’s distance tions were counsels of perfection and it is not claimed that the figures published in Table IX are as reliable as those published in the other tables in the same volume  The return of infirmities at the Indian census has probably never been satisfactory  Notwithstanding instructions to the contrary  it seems likely that many feeble minded and dotards are entered as insane and that many who are partially blind It is probable of course  that the excess numbers so are returned as totally blind  obtained do not even balance the omissions in the return of the infirmities at all where these infirmities none the less exist  In the case of leprosy   however  it is  Instructions to     enumerators   practically certain that the census figures in India fail entirely to represent the true state of affairs  Dr  Muir and others  who have investigated the prevalence of leprosy by means of local surveys  have concluded that the census figures represent  one tenth of the actual  The attempt to record physical disabilities through the medium of the census was abandoned in England and Wales ten years ago as a failure  and earlier still in the United States of America  It was nevertheless decided not to abandon the attempt to return this disease at the census  as the figures which the census is able to provide afford some basis for an estimate of true numbers in the light of the difference between the figures obtained from local surveys and the census returns for the same areas  At the same time the tabulation of infirmity by caste was abandoned in the interests of economy  104 One obvious criticism on the return of infirmities is that while the first three mentioned are defects which may be observed by an enumerator  the fourth is a disease which can only be detected by expert eyes and should not be made the subject of a purely lay return  Those cases which are obvious to the lay eye are burnt out cases no longer infectious  The infectious cases are those at an earlier stage of development  and it is by a comparison of the number of these early cases with the number of those in which the disease has run its course that the increase or decrease of prevalence can be ascertained  Enumerators cannot be expected to add medical diagnosis to their limited ability to record fact  Apart from this  it is quite obvious that there vill be much wilful concealment of such a disease as    leprosy  and since the number of females returned as lepers is 40 019 against 107 892  males  it may perhaps be inferred that concealment among females is greater  as  indeed might be expected in view of customs such as that of purdah   On the other  hand it seems to be generally held that leprosy attacks a greater proportion of males than of females  so that it is impossible to say in what degree the lower figures for females are due to the natural incidence of the disease and in what degree to the circumstances of enumeration  and the concealment inevitable from it  Similarly insanity is likely to be concealed particularly in the case of females  while there is certain to be a tendency to conceal cases of deaf mute children  jloreover  the use of such a term as insanity is frequently a matter of personal temperament and of the very variable value that different individuals attach to identical words  In fact a young lady in Lucknow Cantonment  filling in the schedule for her husband  who  was out at his work but had doubtless had the misfortune to offend her  described him as insane  deaf mute  blind and leprous an extreme case   no doubt  but illuminating  One may fancy an enumerator enquiring as he fills in his schedule as to the sanity of some individual whose behaviour struck him as unusual  The first villager might answer “ Oh  he does be a bit queer  but not what you’d call mad ”  whereas the next might perfectly well say of the same individual “ Mad  is it i Indeed  a March hare ’d be sane to him ”  What is the enumerator to put dbwn  and what will be the value of his record statistically or demographically   The      A return of elephantiasis would probably present less dilliculty to the census staff and in Travancore State such a return was added  though even of this infirmity it was found that concealment was general there In the Nicobar Islands it was proposed to substitute this return for that of leprosy  which is either absent or unde   teeted  whereas elephantiasis is a common scourge  but the proposal was not in the end carried out   M22CO  253  Defects of Returns   the  \f   254  CHAPTER Vn   term blind   ^INFIRMITIES   is liable to a not dissimilar diversity of interpretation  and although the instructions are that only those blind in both eyes shall be recorded as such  this is definitively effective only to the extent of excluding from the record persons with one unquestionably sound eye  It is true of course that the bias of one enu‘  ’  merator is apt to be corrected by the bias of another in the opposite direction  and possible that exaggeration and meiosis so balance one another in the returns that a fairly correct conclusion is reached  but none the less it is impossible to doctor the returns of infirmity like the admittedly inaccurate returns of age  so as to produce out of amalgamated inaccuracies results which are a sufficiently accurate representation of the facts  i Ioreover  some of the inexplicable fluctuations from census to census  and inconsistencies that appear between provinces  make the accuracy of the figures even of blindness open to impeachment  though the returns of blindness have generally been regarded as comparatively accurate  and it is perhaps significant that the Blind Relief Association found by a count that the totally blind in Bijapur District in 1920 numbered 260 per 100 000 as against 70 returned at the census of 1911  On the other hand it cannot be denied that the ratios of the infirm to the rest of the population at successive ages do show a consistency from census to census which is incompatible with any kind offerror but a constant one  indicating that however inaccurate our figures may be numerically they have some real comparative value from census to census  The census figures of infirmity are therefore presented subject to the proviso that although they do indicate tendencies on general lines their value is only comparative  as they cannot be taken to represent actual numbers  Their treatment is therefore primarily confined to this comparative aspect whether in time or in place  and in view of the nature of the material is perhaps justifiably brief  Reference to  105 The main statistics will be found in Imperial Table IX  and the subsidiary tables at the end of this chapter give proportionate and comparative figures  The    lUtistics   marginal statement shows the total number of persons suffering from each of the four infirmities recorded for the last fiity years  The decrease from 1881 to

affliction of the unlike deaf muteness  wiiich is one of the young  or blindness  which is severest in old age  To judge by the Reports of the Public Health Commissioner on mental hospitals the principal causes of insanity in India are mental strain  critical periods of life  e g   puberty   cannabis indica  presumably in the form of ganja or some other preparation  privation  and diseases consequent on malnutrition  epilepsy and syphilis  The total nmnber of patients in mental hospitals in 1930 was 11 147  In 1921 it was 9 919  If any interest is felt in adult period   the extravagant and unpleasant methods of treating insanity in Indian folkmedicine a reference may be made to pages 415 417 of Mr  O Malley’s Report on Bengal  Bihar and Orissa for 1911   107 The figures of this defect if rightly returned should show a curve decreas  Oeaf rauteness  ing wuth each age group  since the disease is congenital  Before 1921 the instructions contained the words deaf mute from birth   omitted in 1921 and 1931  The results in 1921 were imsatisfactory as the omission led to an increased number of returns of aged deaf mutes  presumably cases of deafness senility  and though this was not the case in all units  e g   in Cochin State  the error caused by the indusion of aged persons  probably deaf only  was so marked that it would have been better to have reverted to the 1911 practice of including the words “ from birth ”  though    •  m  this on the other hand may lead to the omission of a certain number whose condition is not realised to have been congenital and the Census Superintendent of  the United Provinces considers that the omission of the words “ from birth ” has led to increased accuracy of the return of iafirmities as a whole  since it has frequently happened that enumerators apply the words   from birth ” to all infirmities instead of to deaf muteness only  Deaf muteness in India  as elsewhere  is frequently associated with cretinism and goitre and may therefore be attributed in part to the absence of iodine salts in the soil and consequently in the drin kin g water  Naturally the absence is most likely to occur in rainy and hilly country where the salts have been washed out of the surface soil at sites inhabited or cultivated for a long period of time  Thus in Baroda the Census Commissioner for that State points out tiie heavy incidence of deaf muteness on the upper reaches of certain streams and in the proximity of the Rann of Cutch  In addition therefore to the marginal table of the distribution and variation of this

perhaps to see less correspondence in the female to the male curve from 10 to 20 years and a greater correspondence from 0 to 10 years  It will be noticed that the steep rise from 0 5 to 5 10 and the slight rise from that group to the next correspond to the ages at which deaf muteness becomes first indubitable to the child’s parents and then cannot be concealed from neighbours  the girl’s curve being here less steep  as one might expect from the point at which the infirmity is patent there is a steady    fall  corresponding to the natural decrease in deaf mutes   who are usually sliort  lived   except for a depression at the 15 20 group corresponding to the age of marriage which may indicate a slight inflation of the previous and subsequent groups at the expense of the 15 20 group  There is no clear rise in old age though the increased figui e for the group 70 and over must represent a certain inclusion of dotards  As in the case of the other infiimities  this group has not been plotted on the curve  since it covers an indefinite number of age groups and is liable to be misleading  A geometrically decreasing ratio from the 60 65 group would not bring extinction before 135 years  but the inaccuracy of return indicated is less than that of 1921  and whereas the group for 70 and over in all other infirmities shows an increase on the 1921 figure  corresponding no doubt to the increased population  that for deaf muteness shows a decrease in 1931  The geographical distribution of deaf muteness shows that the return is not so inaccurate as to obscure the connection between this infirmity and locality  and localities showing a high frequency in 1921 continue to do so in 1931  In particular the distribution of this infirmity shows an association vdth steep and

so the returns are in some cases open to doubt and in any case conceahneut is likely in the case of girls of marriageable age  In AjmerMerwara and in Madras the incidence in 1921 was heaxder on males

VII    ^INFIEMITIES   extremes as Bharatpur and Sixohi Blindness is not marked by a high ratio in tbe hot and dry states in the west of the agency where it might be expected to prevail This the Census Superintendent suggests may be due to faulty enumeration  Again in Bihar and Orissa  though south Bihar conforms to the environmental criterion  north Bihar  just as dusty  returns little more blindness than Orissa and  Chota Nagpur  which are comparatively green and wooded  while the extraordinary fluctuations of the number of the blind  107 per 100 000 in 1911  82 in 1921 and 126 in 1931 make the returns suspect  On the other  hand in Hyderabad State blindness is much more prevalent in Marathwara with a greater intensity of heat  glare and dnst ladengwinds than in the Telingana  ‘Black cotton soil” says the Census Commissioner of that state “ is highly prejudicial ‘  3«tooct     eyesight  ’ ’  Cochin State shows a similar fluctuation  to  that of Bihar and Orissa   but  a  generally increased ratio  while Travancore shows  as in 1921  a higher ratio of bhnd   ness among males  than  among  females   but  greater  increase  among the latter  The Census Commissioner for that state adds “ The evil  PERSONS  of defective eyesight is evident   ly  increasing  among  young  adults   especial   ly students in the higher forms of English schools  and in colleges  The Government of Travancore have realis   ed the seriousness of this evil  and  arranged for the periodical medi   S ood  cal inspection of ^  age  jj  the students ”  This consideration has possibly  \fBLINDNESS   261  something to do with the curve by age groups  which shows juvenile blindness as rather a male than a female phenomenon  even though concealment may account for the depression of the female curve at 15   20 the marriageable age  the steadier increase for females  which is characteristic of Indian returns of blindness in general  is usually put down to their task of cooking over smoky fixes  Apart from the greater incidence of juvenile blindness in males the two curves show  like the curves of deaf muteness  a striking similarity of outline which suggests the possibility of a greater accuracy of the census figures than we have claimed for them in this chapter  Cataract and glaucoma are causes of much blindness which only appear with increasing age  but glaucoma heads the Public Health Commissioner’s list   1929   of the main causes of blindness in India  opthalmia neonatorum  small pox  conjunctivitis  and trachoma following in that order  after w^hich are put neglect    ‘  of simple diseases of the eyes in childhood ’ and  dust and glare especiallv in the dry zone To these are added eye strain under bad lighting conditions and the medicaments of quacks  In this connection the Census Superintendent of Madras ‘  ‘     notes that “ The general knowledge that cataract can be treated surgically has an unfortunate illustration in  the prevalence  of the operation  known as  couching ’  This is a practice of vaids and hakims of merely pushing into deeper parts of the eye  the cloud or flower which constitutes the cataract  There it may  and frequently does  cause much injury even though it can no longer be seen  European surgical practice is to remove the cloud altogether  Careful investigations made at the Ophthalmic Hospital  Madras  showed that out of 836 i ersons whose cataract had been couched only 176 had retained useful sight  The success return from proper surgical practice  on the other hand  is 90 per cent  and even of the remaining 10 per cent  most derive benefit from the operation  Here again propaganda is the onlv remedy and this point is dealt with among others in the literature issued by medical officers in Madras ‘  ‘  ’  A Blind Belief Association  now known as the All India Blind Relief Association  was founded in Bombay in 1919 and is now affiliated to the International Asso   ciation for the Prevention of Blindness   aims in particular at conveving relief treatment is generally inaccessible  Much of the blindness in India is curable and more is preventible  One serious difficulty is the economic one  Cultivators suffering from eye complaints cannot afford to leave the work on their fields for a proIt  and prevention into rural areas in different parts of India where  longed stay in hospital either for themselves or to look after theii’ children there  Consequently proper treatment is only obtained  if at all  too late to be of value  while affections of the eyes are often made worse by the improper treatment of local quacks  Ho apology is needed for quoting again and at length the Census Superintendent of Madras    “ The chief tragedy of blindness is that so much of it in India   probably more than half  and that the majority of incurably or partially blijid become so when infants or young children  tVe are apt to dwell too much on cataract and the iuore spectacular manifestations of blindness and forget the large  share which parental folly and neglect  inqnoper food and housing play in producing the 50 000 blind recorded in thi s presidency  Blindness from cataract de spite the large number of cases is of less re al importance in the life of the communitv  is generally associated with advanced years and is curable  Eyen if no cure is effected the victim has had during the useful stages of his life the   ower of sight  Opthalinia neonatorum  syphilis  small pox  keratomalacia  on the other hand  as causes of blindness all mark their victims before adult years are reached fftid the loss and burden they bring on the conununity are difficult to assess  In the fir st two the fault of the parents is complete  It is their disease which appears as blindness in their child and if all parents established their ov n soundness before begetting children blindness of this sort would yanish  Ophthalmia neonatorum is in any case preyentable after birth by a simple precaution which every woman ought to know unfortunately do not  Indeed it has frequently been but which many  including dais discovered that a fully qualified doctor or midwife had been present at the birth of a child subsequently produced for treatment of this affliction  Blindness from small pox is simply neglected vaccination and parental responsibility runs high  It is higher still when we consider the blindness caused by violent irritants put into the eyes to rouse the child or cure some simple ailment  Chewed red pepper  tobacco juice  red hot coals  strong solution of alum all seem preposterous to Western ears  but all are frequently put into the eyes of Indian childblindness  ren with generally the tragic result of The application of irritants is probably at least as great a cause of blindness in India as ophthalmia neonatorum  Misfortune comes to all  but there is something peculiarly tragic  about misfortune occasioned  is preyentable  ’  by another’s 1I22CC  folly   \f262  CHAPTER Vn    ^mPIBMITIES   Keratomalacia and trachoma come in a different category and the latter is a disease of Its precise cause is not yet known but it is usually associated with bad housing and ventilation  In the opinion of Colonel Wright trachoma is not in India nearly so serious a cause of blindness as in other parts of the world  This may reflect the fact that the Indian house is often much more a receptacle than a dwelling in the European sense and much of the occupants’ day is actually spent in the open air  adults as well as children   opinion of Colonel Wright the greatest single cause of preventable  Keratomalacia is in the This  blindness in India   In Madras blindness is a more common  is not generally recognized   sequel to it than to ophthalmia neonatorum  It is really a multiple deficiency complex in which ophthalmic features  however noteworthy  are but localized signs  Its chief primary aetiologi   A in the diet  and its prevention lies in proper thus linked by cause to the wide range of ailments that begin in malnutrition and it is a significant pendant to McCarrison’s views on the merits of India’s various diets that whereas keratomalacia is common in the rice eating south and the Ganges vaUey it is practically unknown in the wheat and milk consuming Pimjab  A large proportion of the poorer population of this presidency is in what McCarrison would call the twilight zone of nutrition where a small change in dietary may precipitate a deficiency disease  Colonel Wright brought to notice in 1925 a sudden precipitation of keratomalacia in adults who had acquired liver disease  cal factor is apparently lack of fat soluble vitamin  feeding of children   It is  The mode of operation against these preventable causes of blindness is more obvious in some cases than in others but in all propaganda plays a large part  This has been realized and for some years past much has been done by oral and pictorial exhortation to make more widely known what the public should do to reduce or remove preventable blindness  Keratomalacia presents a difficult problem and is not separable from the very much wider economic problem represented by the low standard of living and unsatisfactory dietary prevailing in so large a part of the population  Its prevention is in fact primarily an economic question  The same apparently applies to trachoma  The above causes of blindness which operate so heavily in the first five years of life have a profound influence on the actual total number of blind persons and if they were reduced to proper proportions the blindness diagram would undergo a marked alterat ion ”  L« rMy   109  Were it not for their inaccuracy the figures of leprosy would be the most important of the returns of infirmity made at the census  It is  however  an unsuitable subject for diagnosis by enumerators and it is also one in which concealment is likely to be particularly obstinate  This is reflected in all probability in the great excess returned of male over female lepers  for though it is stated by some authorities that the male is more exposed to this disease  and though it is clear that this is true in the sense that he is the more hkely to contract it away Cen ’^us figures of leprosy  1931 fpom homc  it seems equally probable that the male  who so contracts it  is on the per

Hyderabad among State the few Christian lepers found there were almost as many women The census figures as men  are mainly important as an indication of distribution  On the day after the 1921 census Dr  Muir asked 30 lepers  who knew that they  were lepers  if they had been returned as such and found that only two had been so returned  The census figures have also been used to estimate the actual number of lepers by computing a figure for the whole of India on the basis of the ratio found to exist in hmited areas between the census figures and the numbers obtained by expert survey  This method is also liable to be highly erroneous on account of the very great variations shown in the ratio of areas  The figures resulting census to expert survey returns for different from survey are always higher than the census figures  but the difference seems generally to vary from about 10 times the census figure downwards over In very small units the excess is sometimes much greater  and a large units  municipahty in Malda district  Bengal   that of Enghsh Bazar  had a census figure On the other hand the Census Superintendent for of 3 and a survey figure of 67  Bombay regards the inaccuracy of return as varying according to the incidence of  the disease   He writes  “ The leprosy returns in the Bombay Presidency vary in accuracy probably from within two thirds to one tenth of the truth  the accuracy depending more than anything on the incidence of the disease in particular areas  i Tiere the disease is Tvidely prevalent it is not properly reported  itTiere it is only occasionally found there is no doubt the Census statistics are nearer the truth  In the Ahmednagar district the medical authorities believe that the Census statistics of leprosy are about two thirds correct  In Bombay City the statistics are  believed not to be more than one  tenth correct ”   The 10 to 1 ratio is possibly the commoner in one thana of Bengal a survey    figure of 274 wms returned against a census figure of 30  though three or four times the census figure seems more usual in that province  and in a taluk of Hyderabad  State 538 against 53  but Dr  Lowe estimates the total number of lepers in the Nizam’s Dominions as 60 000 against a census figure of 3 738  The Census Com   missioner of that State describes the 1891 leprosy return of 10 508 as a “ glaring error in enumeration ”  though it would seem to have been much nearer the numerical truth than the subsequent ones  His aspersions are perhaps justified by the unusual sex incidence males 2 598  females 7 910  such an antithesis to aU other Indian returns as to suggest an error in compilation or prmting  Surveys over larger units show a smaller excess than 10 to 1  but it seems not unlikely that the larger the unit the less close the survey  In Ajmer Merwara the census return is 18 lepers only  but 30 persons were actually treated for leprosy in 1930  In Assam the leprosy survey found 11 720 lepers in five districts which returned only 3 843 at the census less than one third  and the Census Superintendent estimates that there are at the very least 20 000 lepers in Assam  His census In Bihar and Orissa

soil where vegetables and fodder do not thrive and where the cereal crops are apt to fail with the inadequate consumption of vegetables and milk  and with the consumption of food of bad quality such as spoiled rice and rotten fish  It is of interest to compare conclusions formed by Dr  ilayer in Xigeria  Apart from certain factors of purely local significance  he mentions poor food condiover crowding of houses and tions  smoke dried fish is excessively popular   prolonged periods of drought and frequent famines as having increased susceptibihty to the disease on account of resultant starvation and dirtiness of clothing  He mentions as predisposing diseases scabies  intimately connected with leprosy  malaria  yaws  syphihs  ankylostomiasis  dracontiasis and one or two others “

be found alongside leprosy in this coimtry  and pyorrhoea is regarded by some as another serious contributor  Ignorance of the danger of contamination is an important factor in the spread of the disease  and the attitude of the Indian village is very different from that of the Nigerian Yoruba tribe which cures lepers dead with a drastic remedy of cold steel  This ignorance or indifference to the  \f   •  LEPROSY   265  disease is well illustrated by the Census Superintendent for Madras     “ The survey parties found that a number of male patients attributed their infection  to contact with leprous paramours or concubines  Apparently yoimg women rejected on account of leprosy as unfit for marriage are allowed to have other connections  The part played by  such activities in the spread of the disease needs no stressing  In South Arcot one man with highly infectious leprosy was found undergoing the preliminary ceremonies of marriage  AVith the aid of the villagers the marriage was postponed for sis months  an encouraging instance of communal action for the public weal  One village in Salem district has a number of male lepers to whom infection was conveyed through the ministeratioirs of a leper barber In another village an actively infectious leprosy case was found sharing a hooka with the other men of the village this illustrates well the part played by ignorance in the spread of the disease  Leprosy is easily conveyed if the skin is already abraded ”    Oldiieve notes the following cases  among others  of observed lepers from one small district A scullion at a railway refreshment room another in a missionary’s house a preparer of oil for curries another such a ghi seller’s wife a woman milk seller another milk woman a vegetable seller a sweetmeat maker a baker a cigarette maker and his wife a stitcher of leaves for wrapping food a sub assistant surgeon working in a hospital The Census Superintendent of Madras remarks that leprosy like tuberculosis is a disease of semi civilization’                                                 ‘  “ It is in the contact zones that these diseases have their widest range         AVhere a primitive  mode of life is in contact with a more advanced  where simple habits have been modified but adaptation is not complete  leprosy finds a wide field  Coolie s and factory hands provide the bulk of the specimens  In these cases a new mode of life is in most obwous impingement upon  a simpler predecessor ” Similarly it is observed in Nigeria that tribes which have recently taken to clothing as a result of contact between Muslims in the north and Europeans in the south are at a stage in which they are more liable to acquire leprosy  The reason given is that they wear clothing but do not wash it  having forsaken the healthy nakedness of their forefathers to adopt foreign fashions of clothing without the necessary corollary of soap and water and changes of raiment  That the spread of leprosy can be unexpectedly rapid is shown by the records of a case in East Prussia where from a single importation 50 lepers were found to have been infected in the course of 30 years  It may be added that in many  possibly in all parts of India a It is perhaps improbable leper’s body is not burned but buried or cast into water  that infection is ever thus conveyed but it seems a pity that cremation is not  employed   Apart from the leprosy centre at the School of Tropical Medicine the two most important bodies engaged in the anti leprosy „„„ Lepers treated in institutions  1929  t are the t   n ^

afflicted in Travancore according to the returns is 14 709  that is 288 per 100 000 the proportion of females being returned as 746 per 1 000 males  the difference being more likely to be due to

pointed out that Indian students in Europe very frequently contract tuberculosis  King George’s Thanksgiving Fund  with a capital of over 9  lakhs raised by public subscription  aims at the prevention of tuberculosis by educational measures  and at a survey of the prevalence of the disease  Mortality from tuberculosis has been reduced b   over o0% in western countries and could ruidoubtedly be

Pilgrimages are important distributors  and the great Kumbh mela of 1930 at Allahabad proved to be followed  as anticipated  by a year of high epidemicity  Plague has similarly been greatly reduced during the decade  Mortality from plague in the Punjab was higher in 1924 than in any year since 1907  when it was considerably more than The United Provinces twice the 1924 figure  and it was also above normal in 1926  figure for 1923 26 exceeded those of 1915 and 1916  but has not reached the mortality of any other year in the previous decade  and the other provinces have all shown a generally corresponding improvement  1921  1922  1927  1928 and 1929 were all years of exceptionally low plague mortahty and the figure for 1 930 has been lower than for any year since plague came to India through Bombay  Probably the rats of India are developing immunity  as the extent to which they appear to be immune is greatest where plague has been worst  On the other hand Assam and in a lesser degree Bengal and Burma are free from plague though their rat population This freedom has not been satisfactorily is reported to be highly susceptible  explained  Karachi  India’s chief port for the export of grain has been free from plague siuce 1926  Mortality from small pox was slightly less for 1921 1929 than for the corresponding 9 years of the previous decade  but India remains the greatest centre of small pox in the world  Some 600 000 cases of venereal disease are treated annually in hospitals but no other statistics of these diseases are available  Beri beri is endemic round the western stores of the Bay of Bengal  the centre of the focus of infection lying round about Masuhpatam towards the north of the Coromandel Coast  The disease is seasonal  prevaihng during the later part of the monsoon  and is commonest in communities living on raw milled and polished rice  and as might be expected outbreaks occur in small communities h Tng under special conditions  such as felling camps in forests  or mihtary poHce outposts obviously among persons living on milled rice supphed as rations  In 22 000 cases treated Of other diseases ankylostomiasis  hookworm   in 1929

Mysore  are free for practical purposes  as also Central India and the greater part of the Central Provinces  In the eastern provinces and in Madras  where infection is appreciably more prevalent  the infection is in most places so shght as to be negligible except in certain The seriously infected areas may be regarded as confined to the locahties  intermediate zone in the plains of Burma  between

in which for on the census schedule  the enumerator was to describe the enumerated as an earner or a dependant  and to enter in the case of an earner his principal occupation  his most important subsidiary occupation if he had any  and the industry in which he was employed     Instructloilf to  Enumerator   A complete compilation of figures of subsidiar ^ occupations has been attempted at  X  gives complete details by sex for each this census for the first time  and Table dependant was not regarded as having any group instead of for orders only   A  principal occupation but was to be recorded in the column for subsidiary occupation as following any occupation which contributed to the family maintenance  Such a dependant was distinguished as a working dependant from the nonworking dependants following no occupation  and in this chapter the term earner is used of a wage receiver or subsistence obtainer in either principal or subsidiary occupation  and the term worker is used of all such persons together with those following an occupation as working dependants  i e  not themselves receiving the wage or controlling the means of subsistence gained  The term actual worker is used with reference to all workers in principal and dependant occupations excluding the numbers of individuals duplicated by their appearing also as earners by means of subsidiary occupations  but in this chapter the subject is approached rather from the aspect of the total number of different means of subsistence engaging the whole working population than from the aspect of the maximum number iDf the actual workers occupied     ‘  ’  ‘  ’  ‘  ‘  ’  The definition of industry was employment on wages in company with any other person by a third person  This definition of course covers many nonindustrial forms of employment but it was intended to eliminate these in the process of selection for compilation and to tabulate only those industries known to be of importance in any given locality  Unfortunately the imperative need for drastic economy led to the abandonment of any sort for or tabulation of industry  this particular item in the census programme being one of those selected for curtailment as the reports from most provinces suggested that the returns of industry were not entirely satisfactory owing to misunderstandings on the part of enumeraThey did however often prove very useful in tors as to exactly what was wanted  enabling occupations to be classified  Misunderstandings such as those affecting the return of industry are familiar in the Indian census schedule and were the cause of one of the changes O in the form of the schedule made at this census  In 1911 and 1921 enumerators were instructed to return in the case of dependants the “ occupation on vehich dependent ”  an instruction which always gave rise to much misunderstanding and consequently unsatisfactory results  The abandonment of this instruction means that there can be no final distribution of the dependence of the total population on the various occupations derived from the indi ddual returns  but there is no reason to suppose that an estimate of this distribution cannot be obtained from an examination of the returns of earners and working dependants  which will be as satisfactory for practical purposes as the one obtained from the incompletely comprehended and unsatisfactory returns of occupation on which dependent obtained on previous occasions  for a change was also involved the instructions that a dependant might be regarded as having an occupation  The former division was into workers and dependants  and the instruction was that all persons contributing to the family maintenance should be regarded as workers  so that the earners plus working dependants gf 1931 are in effect equivalent to the workers of 1921 with the advantage that it is  or should be  possible to distinguish between those who are actually in receipt of earnings and those who n re merely helpers thus in Cochin  for instance  the proportion of earners plus working dependants to the total population in 1931 273 M22CC  in  ‘  ‘  ‘  ’  ’  ’     ‘  ’  ‘  ’  F  \f274  CHAPTER VIII    OCCUPATION   almost identical with the proportion that workers were to it in 1921  On the other hand there was in some cases a tendency to try and interpret earner in the sense attached to the word worker ’ in 1921  thus obscuring the distinction between earner and working dependant  while the figures of working dependants and others have probably been biassed here and there by a snobbish feeling that it is not so respectable for women to be working as to be non working dependants  particularly where the observance of purdah is a mark of social superiority  is  ‘  ’  ‘  ’     Reforenee to figures   Workers and Dependants   X  113  The figures of occupation will be found in Table of part II  and the proportional figures in the subsidiary tables at the end of this chapter are preceded by a copy of the complete scheme of classification  In interpreting the returns the method here followed is first to attempt some examination of the distribution of occupation on broad lines  that is by classes and sub classes involving divisions on very general lines only  and then to attempt some examination of the statistics in greater detail with reference to orders  and where necessary to individual groups  as classified in the scheme appended to this chapter  The final section consists of a brief note on occupation and caste with reference to Table XI in part II  114  Instead of the proportion of non working dependants to workers having been reduced by the new distinction between earners and working dependants  as was anticipated  the proportion of non working dependants has increased  In 1921 out of every hundred persons 46 were workers to 54 dependants  In 1931 there were 44 workers to 56 dependents  That this is due in part  to a predilection for returning total instead of working dependence is possibly indicated by the figures for sexes engaged in agriculture  in which the number of males returned as workers has increased during the decade by nearly two million  while the number of females has so far decreased  that is by nearly five million  as to reduce the total number of agricultural workers to less than the total of 1921  The quite exceptional increase in females under head domestic service shows at once however where the bulk of these workers appears  It is certainly regarded as much more socially respectable for a wife to be engaged at home on household duties than to labour in the fields  and there is a generally increasing tendency  as castes aspire to a higher social standing  to keep their  women at home   On the other hand the proportion of children to adults  and therefore of dependants to workers is unquestionably higher than it was in 1921  while it is not unlikely that part of the increase in dependence as compared with  work is due to the increasing difticulty of getting employment and earning an independent hvohhood  keeping youths  in the middle classes at any rate  dependent on their families whereas 10 years ago they would have been earning  Earners and Workers   115  The proportion of earners to working dependants is about nine to two  that is of the total working population 81 4percent  is in direct receipt of wages or of other means of subsistence wheieas the other 18 6 per cent  are helpers of the This statement however is to be accejTed only with considerable wage earners  reserve  as the practice of previous decades in which the division was merely into workers and dependants  all who contributed indirectly in the earning of wages being shown in the former category  undoubtedly influenced in practice the distinction chawn at this census between receivers of earnings and their helpers  a distinction difficult enough in any case where the nature of the occupation is such that the earnings are obtained in the form of natural jiroducts which are consumed by the producer without ever being exchanged for coin  Occupations of this sort  including as they do both agricultiue and stock rearing  at any rate to a considerable degree  probably form the great majority in India  and the instructions given were that in such cases the owner or householder should be regarded as the earner and the working members of this family as working dependants  The figures returned however indicate that the interpretation of earner has frequently been wider than was intended by the instructions given  at any rate in class A  subIt would appear also from the returns that the instruction that the class 1  actual occupation followed should be returned by working dependants  and not the occupation of the principal earner where the two dift’ered  has been often Thus it is difficult to see how the male and female working misunderst  od  dependants returned under group 157  Police  can represent persons whose occupation is the preservation of the public peace or the arrest of offenders  since generally speaking police officers are appointed under special warrants  \fEARNERS AND WORKERS   275  and it is an offence to impersonate them  On the other hand the numbers in this case are few  and in out of the way parts of India the most unexpected conditions are apt to prevail  and it is not inconceivable that police are to be found whose office is hereditary  or an ex officio accompaniment of some other post and is automatically filled by the relatives of the usual functionary when he is indisposed or engaged in other pursuits  while the term police would include for census purposes persons whose services were essentially in that department though not themselves involving the alleged unhappiness of constabulary duties  The females whose principal occupation is found in this group include of course wardresses in prisons as well as policewomen  Similarly the 21 female working dependants on the Air Force are easily explicable as the wives and families of caretakers  bhistis  etc   who help the earner or deputize in his absence  Nevertheless the difficulty of obtaining correct returns of occupation as required by the census cede is illustrated by the return from the remote Himalayan principality of Poonc ’ of 40 000 odd females whose principal or subsidiary occupation was stated as mechanic  unspecified ’ The not un natural enquiry suggested by these remarkable figures  coming from  with the possible exception of the Amindivi f slands  about the most unlikely area within the scope of operation s to produce quantities of female mechanics  resulted in their  DISTRIBUTION OF  V ORKERS BY OCCUPATION  ’  ‘  ‘  reclassification

classes corresponds very closely to the proportion of workers in each of those classes  which is precisely what might be expected on a priori grounds  and from the figiu es in paragraph 86 above  which indicate that there is no very great variation according to occupation in the number of children born and that what variation there is is equalised by a sur^^val rate wdiich varies inversely to the  number of births  Occupational Classification   117  Occupations were classified as in 1911 and in 1921 according to the Bertillon system  which was fully de  ^cribed by Sir Edward Gait in his report on the former census  The scheme has come in for a great deal of criticism at the hands of Census  Superintendents and others  but none of the critics have succeeded in propounding any sati sfactory alternative  and while criticisms are usually directed to the complexity and alleged excessive detail in the grouping  suggestions for improvement offered by departments of Government usually take the form of requiring much more detailed grouping than that already provided  This latter attitude results from losing sight of the fact that  to quote Sir Edward Gait  “the whole scheme  as adapted for India  is based on the axiom that a census does not supply data which are suitable for minute classification ”  If this axiom be not strictly observed it becomes impossible to keep down the number of detailed heads  and classification in the compilation offices would be made unconscionably slow and difficult  while the already existing degree of inaccuracy would probably be greatly enhanced  As it is the problem of sorting the occupation of each inchvidual into his proper category is too intricate to be carried out with entire satisfaction and as it is in abihty to classify correctly that Indian sorting offices are particularly deficient  It is likely that the degree of error in classification is already greater in the occupation table than that in any other  Indeed problems frequently arise in classification which offer very considerable difficulty  It is simple enough when confronted with a return of “ Bande Mataram ” as a means of subsistence to allocate the indmdual to  \fOCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION   277  group 195  Other unclassified non productive industries  probably the most fit place for him whatever he had returned  but “ Professional identifying witness ” is more difficult  Should he go into the same category  or should it be group 1 68  Lawyers  clerics  petition writers  etc    The latter would probably wish to relegate him to “ Charity receiver on burial group 157  but there is much  drtue in an etcetera groimd ” suggests mendicancy at first sight  but probably represents a Mahabrahman and would be rightly classified in group 166  Servants in religious edifices  burial grounds  etc   together with “ Pourer of water on gods ”  but one is a little puzzled as to whether “ Driving away epidemics by charms ” should go with “ Averters of hailstorms” into group 181  Astrologers  fcrrtune tellers  horoscopecasters  wizards  witches and mediums  or into group 170  Persons  unregistered  practising the healing art  with the leech  familiar in India with his little horns and cupping tools  who retmned his occupation as “ Sucking bad blood ”  “ Ear wax remover ” should probably go into the same category  but the alternative of order 12  Industries of dress and thf  toilet  where the barbers are foimd  inevitably occurs to one  as it does in the case of “ Setting gold nails in teeth ”  which might ‘‘ also be group 171  Dentists  or 98  Mahers of jewellery and ornaments  Brealdng the horns of dead bullocks ” is probably group 53  but one would like to know more of the eschatology of the said horns  and “ Searcher of conch shells ”  particularly in the Central Provinces whence returned  is completely defeating  Indeed it is most suggestive as a basis of archaeological as well as industrial enquiry and it can hardly be classified in group 19  collectors offorest produce  though it might conceivably be a Naga from Assam looking for the cheapest market to buy in  “ Cradle swinger ” not only adds a touch of domesticity  but indicates the extreme differentiation of fimction which so often characterizes the life of a household in India  Difficulties of classification being what they are  it was natural to attempt at the outset to simplify the occupational scheme by a widening of categories and a reduction of groups as a result however of the insatiable desire of departments for more detailed figures the attempt ended in an increase of groups from 191 to 195  as the amalgamations which it was possible to induce them to accept were more than counterbalanced by the additional details which opportunity instigated them to On the whole  however  the occupational grouping was probably more require  satisfactory than in 1921 from the census point of view  and as far as their comparative value goes there has been little if any loss  as there has been no rearrangement at all of classes  sub classes or orders except for the reduction of one order in sub class II  Exploitation of Minerals  where the three orders of 1921  Mines  Quarries  and Salt  embracing six groups between them  have become two orders only  Metallic minerals and N on metallic minerals  a much more logical division but embracing now thirteen groups instead of six  A few minor transfers have been made among groups  where the existing clas siThus group 101 of 1921 including persons fication seemed unsuitable or inaccurate  which then appeared under order 18  entertainment  employed in places of Other industries ’ now undefined appears as group 183  order 49  submiscellaneous and The title of

artful they must be  Similarly a certain number of occupations vTongly classified in 1921 have been allocated to different groups at this census  Saddle cloth makers and embroiderers have been reclassified as workers in textiles instead of in leather  while sellers of the finished article have been included under trade in textiles instead of trade in means of transport  Sellers of grasshoppers were classified in 1921 under “ trade of other sorts ”  they have been reclassified this time under “ trade in foodstuffs ”  Changes of this kind  and few at that  are not likely to have affected the comparative values of the returns  A complete scheme of the occupational classification in 1931 wiU be found at the end of this chapter  and it will be convenient to reprint here the note of 1911 in which Sir Edward Gait explains the principles then and since ‘     ’  Vm  ‘  followed in classifying occupation  “  1  Where a person both makes and sells  he is classed under the

of persons who have returned their occupation by some such vague term as contractor  shop keeper  clerk  labourer  without giving the information necessary to classify them in any definite category  It is likely therefore that those engaged in the preparation and supply of material substances number some 2 000 in every 10 000 instead of only 1 756   PROPORTIONATE DISTRIBUTION OF OCCUPATIONS  The

figures call for a word of comment   The  very high figure against D in Madras is caused by the large numbers of insufficiently described occupations  probably to be redistributed between I  III and V   The  high proportion of industrial occupations in the Punjab is a recurrent feature and  was noticed at any rate in 1911   In Burma the high proportion of trade is largely  induced by the extent to v hich women engage in trade both as a principal and as a subsidiary occupation     the unexpected industrial figure is again occasioned by the  participation ol women as dependent workers and probably by the extent to which village industries are practised as subsidiary to agriculture or other occupations  and the high figure of transport reflects the comparatively sparse population scattered in many cases on long lines of communication  by river  or  by road   Similarly in Hyderabad State the high proportion of transport workers is possibly  due to the comparative absence  at any rate till recently  of easy conamunications  by road or rail   It should perhaps be pointed out that in  sub class I as agricultural and not in sub class III   Assam tea appears in  The table of

The insufficiently described occupations in that class are  at anv rate in the great majority of cases  general terms connected with industry and trade such trade as ‘ shopkeeper contractor or coolie ’ which cannot be allotted to any particular category  It is possible that the greater prevalence of unemployment in 1931 as compared to 1921 has contributed to diverting returns from definite to indefinite categories  The census schedule contained no provision for any distinction between a man employed in Ids normal calling and one having a calling but temporarily unoccupied  and in the case of many callings in industry and trade the distinctive function of the individual will largely depend on w^hat he is doing at the time when the census takes place  since the particular direction of his energies wnll normally vary from time to time according to the demand for labour or goods or the nature of openings that present themselves  Thus a labour contractor might be returned at one census under transport by road  at another transport by rail and at a third under transport by w ater according to the purpose for w hich he supplied the labour  If wdthout a contract  he would be a contractor and nothing more  and therefore relegated to class The same ob^dously applies to much labour and in point of fact to a considerable volume of industrial and trading occupations in India where industry in general is less specialised and functions less differentiated than in highly industrialized countries of the west  The other changes since 1921 call for little comrnent  The increase in sub class IV  Transport  ’s natural and expected  Communications have everpvhere increased  roads are better  and motor traffic has become ubiquitous during the decade  Indeed if there is any cause for doubt it is whether the increase has not reallv been c^reater than that indicated by the figures  The increase in sub class VIII  Professions and Liberal Arts  is the natural accompaniment of the gradual spread of literacy  The decreases in sub classes VI and VII Public Force and Public Administration  indicate either that there has been no increase in those occupations which is commensurate with the increase in population  or an absolute decrease which is very slight except in the case of the Army  There has also been a decrease in sub class XII which comprises inmates of asylums  gaols and institutions  beggars  vagrants  prostitutes and similar classes  It will be observed from the more detailed examination of the figures in § ii of this chapter that there is a general tendency towards increase in what may be described as modernized occupations  though the degree of that increase is perhaps less than one would be inclined to expect to find   D   717  Miscellaneous  X  1 332

figures were given of the numbers of actual workers who were partly agricultural but whose principal occupation was not agriculture  These totalled 53 per 1 000 for India while those who returned agriculture as a subsidiary occupation in 1931 numbered 44 per 1 000  almost certainly an understatement  and it is probably not without significance that there are just 9 females per mille of all occupations who have returned domestic ser dce as their subsidiary occupation it is likely that they help in agriculture as The tendency when in doubt is to return agriculture as the principal occuwell  pation on account of its respectable status  in preference to returning it as subsidiary  and in any case the returns of subsidiary occupations of all kinds are probably       Distribution

though the figures of this group are not enough to affect perceptibly the ratio for the sub class as a whole  in which it is lower than in any other subclasses except Public Force  Pubhc Administration and Transport  123  It has already been explained that at this census special returns from establishments employ Y7 tnsu ficienttff describeot oe upa‘ ing organized labour were not called for  and that Xn Unproctu etctre owing to the necessity for retrenchment at the compilation stage one of the sorts abandoned was occupations other than that for the return of industry made on the general schedule  as most Census Superintendents regarded the returns in this column as not very satisfactory  In any case the number of workers employed in organized labour is extraordinarily low for a population the size of India’s and the daily average number of hands employed by establishments The in British India to which the Factories Act applies is only 1 553 169  total India figure for persons occupied in plantations  mines  industry and transport in 1921 was 24 239 555 of whom only 2 685 909 were employed in mines  Organized plantations or organised industrial establishments having 10 or more employees  Industry  The total figure under the three same heads in 1931 amounts to 26 187 689  and if labour in similar establishments is in the same proportion it will now number 2 901 776  Figures of the daily average of persons employed indicate that it has increased during the last decade at the rate of about 30 per cent   in which case it will now number 3 500 000  Probably 5 000 000 may be fairly taken as the figure of organized labour in India in 1931  as the figure of 3i million represents only the daily attendance in registered factories  It has been claimed that Indian factory labour is very largely of the casual description that it is not skilled and it is not recruited even from the hereditary trades to which it might be expected to look for its supply   that while the hereditary weaver is maintaining a precarious existence weavdng AAaddcr at greater cost than is required for machine made fabric  the mills producing the latter seek their labour in the casual labour market  recruiting very largely from agriculturists who come and work in the mills for a time and then go back to their villages and that the same applies to most forms of factory labour in India  It is true that indusa fact obvious enough at the census when the trial labour is continually changing final enumeration was checked against the preliminary one  but the bulk of it is probably semi skilled  and in any case factory conditions bear little relation to hereditary handicraft  The conditions imder which it lives are frequently incredibly squahd and overcrowded  vide  for instance  paragraphs 43 and 51 above  and there is little wonder that countrymen will not bring their wives and families Housing conditions may to liv^e in industrial centres if they can help it  is

incidence of disease and mortality it has already been pointed out  paragraph 109 above  that This kind of labour coolies and factoiv hands provide the majority of leprosy cases  when unprotected is easily sweated  The groivth  for instance  of the tobacco industry is pointed out below  and the number of persons employed in this industry has increased from less than 48 000 in 1921 to nearly 148 000 in 1931  They work mainly in biri factories which employ no mechanical power and are therefore outside the operation of the Factories Act  Much child labour is employed and the AVhitley Commission remarked that “ workers as young as five years of age may be found in souse of these places working without adequate meal intervals or weekly rest days  and often for 10 or 12 hours daily  for sums as low as 2 annas in the case of those of tenderest years ”  The factories themselves are often merely slum buildings occupied for the purpose  The Census Superintendent of Madras writes of the bin making industry as follows         There is great variety in size in the manufacturing  units it depends chiefly on the premises available  Where a godown or shed is used the employees may run up to 150 or 200 where a house is used 50 would be a maximum and 30 an average  There is a good deal of employment of children and long hours  Parents take a small advance from the employer of their children and so are little disposed to protest unduly or to withdraw them  The lighting and sanitary arrangements of the establishments are far from good  or are almost nil  Payment is by outturn  generally about 12 annas a thousand  The ordinary workman’s performance would be about 100 an hour  Children are usually paid by the week  payment varying with capacity and age  The Factory Act does not apply to these places because no power is used  If section 2 were extended to them  it could be defeated by keeping the numbers below ten  A tendency towards smaller units seems already apparent  North Arcot is one of the strongholds of beedi making  with 74 factories and 1 200 workers  half of whom were children  These They can be set up  closed and transferred with factories are cssentiall   fluctuating in nature  equal ease  It is certain that a good deal of this form of employment has not entered the census returns ”       A non official bill has been introduced to deal with the biri industry in Madras  but the evil is very far from being confined to that province and the Census Supeiintendont of the Central Provinces and Berar draws attention to the conditions of this industry in Bhandara and Jubbulpore  Similar conditions will probably be found to exist in other industries which do not employ mechanical power  and India may be fortunate in the present backwardness of her industrial development if it enables her to avoid allowing it to grow further on these lines  There are  it is true  a few notable exceptions to the general conditions of the housing and treatment of labour  and Jamshedpur has already been mentioned  paragraph 51  Messrs  Binny at Madras and the Empress Mills at Nagpur might be added  but the industrial concerns which pay much attention to the accommodation of their employees outside the factory itself are the exception and very far from being the rule  though inside the factories themselves conditions are generally satisfactory in the case of establishments within the scope of the Factories Act        Exploitation of  animals and Vegetation   Section ii Statistics of Orders and Groups  124  Order I  Pasture and Agriculture  occupies 71

Fruit  etc   c   o   \f      PASTURE AND AGRICULTURE   287  was divided up into agents of owners  agents of Government  rent The first group  that of landlords  is in effect the same as in 1921  for though it was desired to distinguish  real agricultural non cultivating proprietors from those whose interest in the land was indirect  it proved quite impossible in practice and it was ultimately necessary to define landlords as rent receivers and include all non cultivators receiving income in money or kind from the labours of others on the land  Rights in land in India are complicated and involved to a degree incredible to persons famihar only with the simpler tenures of western Europe  and between the man who cultivates it and the man who nominally owns it there are often a number of intermediate holders of some interest or other in the produce of the land  Holders of such intermediate rights have technical names which vary from one locality to another and any attempt to classify and sort for them would involve technicalities much too numerous and intricate for a census staff to deal with  apart from the fact that the actual agents  collectors  clerks  etc   rights involved are frequently the subject of highly controversial dispute among the  N  concerned  Group I therefore of on cuhivating Proprietors taking Rent in Money or Kind  includes all persons returned under the convenient label of rent receiver’  a simple definition easily understood  and numbers 4 per cent  of the total of occupations described as cultivation’  of which percentage less than a quarter are subsidiary to some other calhng  The great bulk of cultivators appear in groups 5  6 and 7 as Cultivating Owners  TenantCultivaUrrs or Agricultural Labourers  fairly evenly dmded as regards total numbers  owners being the fewest of the three and labourers including large numbers of working dependants who assist either owners or tenants in the cultivation of their holdings  A difficulty of definition was also raised by the term ‘cultivating owners’  Freehold tenures  as understood in Britain  are conspicuous by their absence in India generally  and the variety of tenancies and sub tenancies particularly in Bengal  is legion  A census definition of ownership was found unexpecteclly difficult to frame in any simple manner which would be consistent in most provinces  and ultimately ownership was defined as the possession of rights of occupancy  a term which covered all cultivators holding on a lease from Government as well as many otheis with a conditional or preferential right to their holdings subject to periodic reassessment of rents  Such owueis formed 27 per cent  of the total engaged in cultivation and 18 per cent  of the total of actual workers in all occupations  these percentages including those foi whom such ownership was only a subsidiary means of subsistence  The only previous figures which attempted to make any sort of distinction between owners and tenants were those of 1891  They are not strictly comparable  as the figures given include all non working dependants  but in so far as they afford any comparison they indicate an increased proportion in 1931 of cultivating owners to cultivating tenants  The figures are given below parties  ‘  ‘  1931   1891  ^  ^     Census description   Land occupants  cul   t  Census description

area held by Chettiars increased by 140 percent  between July 1st  1930 and June 30th  1932  That this has also taken place in India generally is perhaps suggested by the apparent increase in the proportion of agricultural labourers to owners and tenant cultivators  These tw o categories appeared in 1921 under the common designation “ ordinary cultivators ”  and for every 1 000 ordinary cultivators there were 290 agricultural labourers who then appeared in two groups as “farm servants” and “field labourers”  In 1931 it must be remembered that the W’orking dependants of owner and tenant cultivators have appeared as dependent workers in the category of agricultural labour  and the proportion therefore of agricultural labourers to cultivators is inflated by these figures  yielding 515 labourers for 1 000 cultivators if all actual workers are taken and 519 if  M22CC  n  \fCHAPTEE  288  VIII   OCCUPATION   subsidiary occupation be also included  If however we rely on

principal occupation  in which case the resulting ratio is 407 agricultural labourers to every 1  000 cultivators  In any case the change in ratio is somewhat  remarkable  even when adopting the lowest ratio which can be compared with that of 1921  Possibly the explanation is that a large increase has taken place in the agricultural population without a corresponding increase in actual holders of land whether as tenants or owners though it is likely that a concentration of land in the hands of non cultivating owners is also taking place   The marginal table shows the distribution

each agriculturalist there is 2 9 acres of cropped land of which 0 65 an acre is irrigated  The corresponding figures for 1921 are 2 7 and 0 61 If however we take only the figures of owner and tenant

rail trafirc  and the decrease in tlie latter in respect to the former is nor alisr lute  but merely a relatively lower rate of increase  since railway employee   of nil kind    have increased  and

306 lea whig out of account 24 persons who found in it a sulisidiary occupation in 1931  The numbers are of course insignificant in any case  As regards the increase of labour on transport generally it should perhaps be pointed out that part of this increase may merely be due to the fact that the cen sus fell earlier this time than in 1921 and therefore nearer tlm height of the working season  How far thi s ailected fhe numbers it is impossible to say  but it is not likely to have accounted for more than a fraction of the increase   d  ti tr s   Trade   128  The figures for Trade generally  show a slight absolute decrease as compared with 1921  apart from the relative decrease shown bv the table in paragraph 119 above  for the number of workers occupied declined from just over to just under eight million  taking no account  of course  of the million and a half who returned trade of some kind as a subsidiary occupation in 1931  It is tempting to put down this decline to the economic depression generally  which was possibly making itself felt in indh idual trades before the effect was perceptible to the community as a whole  Such a reason can perhaps be safely relied on to explain the fall in the number of workers occupied in group 115  Bank managers  Moneydenders  etc   and their employees  from 345 000 in 1921 to 329 500 in 1931  when there were also 153 000 who found in it a subsidiary occupation   and in group 116  Brokers  Commission Agents  Commercial travellers  etc   which declined from 91 000 to 64 000  Seventeen orders are included in sub class V  Trade  and the

the increases the most noticeable is that in group 127  Owners and managers of hotels  cookshops  etc   and their employees  a rise of 53 per cent  from 99 000 to 152 000  indicating probably a greater mobility of the population and a definite change in manners  The other increases are noire of them particularly significant unless it be that in Order 38  which is mainly occasioned by an increase in group 148  Publishers  Booksellers  Stationers  Dealers in Music  etc   indicative of the gradual spread of literacy  Among the decreases the heaviest is that in Order 32  where workers occupied in trade in foodstuffs apart from eating houses have fallen from 4 258 000 to 3 837 000  In spite of an increase in makers of furniture  group 88  paragraph 126 above   workers in Order 34 have declined in number from 72 000 to 61 000  possibly a change in classification only  and workers in Order 35 from 39 000 to 22 000  In Order 36 there has naturally been a rise in group 142  Dealers and hirers in mechanical transport  from 3 000 to 8 200  although gi oup 143  Dealers and hirers in other carriages  carts  boats  etc   compare groups 92 and 108  shows a rise of not far from double  from 19 000 to 35 600  As already pointed out however this order as a whole has fallen  the fall being determined by the decrease in group 144  Dealers and hirers in elephants  camels  horses  asses  m ides  etc   the decrease in which has  so far overbalanced tlie increase in 142 and 143 as to cause a decrease in the tlrree combined from 135 000 to 111 000  In Order 39  Trade of other sorts  the rise of over 209 000 is almost entirely accounted for by the rise in group 150  General store keepers and shopkeepios other wise unspecified        37   129  Turning to sub cla ss VI  Public Force  the decrea se shown in paragraph 119 above is not only relative but absolute  since tlie total numl er employed uncler this head  exclusive of those  99 900  who find a sub sidiarv occupation therein  mostly as villlage watchmen  for whom no comparative figures are available  has The decrease in the Army  lioth Imperial and fallen from 1 040 000 to 841 000  State Forces has been one of 28 per cent   the figures having fallen from 440 000 to 317 000  The Navy and Air Force have increased  but the numbers are in significant  Police  group 157  have increased by 7 amounting only to about 3 000 in all  per cent  only  less than the rate of increase of the total population  while village  group 158  have decreased by 95 700  a figure wdiich suggests that this occupation has

OCCUPATION   294  162  Village officials and servanti other than watchmen   an occupation returned in 1931 as subsidiary by 112 000 persons  it is not unlikely that the decrease has  been caused by the return of the occupation as subsidiary instead of principal  Of the other three groups in this order group 160  Service of Indian and Foreign States  shows a decrease of 17 000  while group 159  Service of the State  shows an increase of over 8 000  The returns under these two heads are often confused  and it is impossible to be certain either that the decrease in group 160 or the increase in group 159 does not really refer to the other group in each case  but taken together the decrease in the service of the state amounts to nearly 9 000  On the other hand there has been an unequivocal rise amounting to just under 51 000 in group 161  ill MJe ictjiaZ Service  which now  afi’ords an occupation to 145 000 persons  as against 94 000 in 1921  to say nothing of some 6 000 who find a subsidiary occupation in the same group  This increase is clearly due to the extension of local   elf government  Profewions  and Liberal Arte   130  The total returns under sub class VIII show an increase over 1921 of about 229 000  as well as 414 000 who find a subsidiary occupation in this sub class which is divided into five orders  Of Distribution of 1 000 occupations in these Orders No

commgr ext  there is one of these to  every 664 workers in India   then No  166  Temple Servants  etc   and finally group 165  Other Religious Workers  Order No  49  Letters  Arts and Sciences also shows a decrease 19 000   This is a heterogenecus order including  as it does actors   •  dancers  entertainers of all sorts  musicians  artists  scientists  witches  astrologers  economists  journalists and public scribes  In this order a very noticeable decrease  half a s much again that in the order as a whole  is found under group 177  Architects  Surveyors  Engineers and their employees  not being State servants    The  decrease here of over 26 000 persons is difficult to account for  but may conceivably be correlated with the decrease in building industries already pointed out  They  cannot all have been employed on building New Delhi in 1921 and have gone out have returned their emjployment as subsidiary  as that total in this group amounts to 1 430 only  Probably the 1921 returns included those who were State servants  but here again there is no corresponding increase except under group 161  municipal servants  where part of this decrease may perhaps be sought  Group 182  Musicians  Actors  Dancers  etc   shows a decrease in females only  The other orders in this sub class show an increase  The most pronounced is that in order 47  Medi ^ of business since  nor can they   Li trituticn of 1 000 workers in  cine   Medicine   i e   Eegistered practitioners  includ   which shows an increase  of 25 per cent   the  of  63 000   number following  241  occupations in this order  apart from those for whom they are subsidiary 50 900  being Unregistered persons practising 381 now  318 600 against 255 500 in 1921  Much the healing art  of the increase is represented by females  Dentists 11 The distribution of 1 000 workers in this Midwives  vaccinators  com355 order is show n in the marginal table  There pounders  nurses  etc  has also been an increase in order 48  Veterinary surgeons 12 Instruction  of 49 per cent   group 174  Professors and Teachers of all kinds having risen from 310 000 to 462 800  apart  from 51 000 who find a subsidiary occupation in this category  Group 175  Clerks and servants connected with education  has risen almost proportionally  Order 46  Law  has also increased by 36 per cent  from 98 000 to 133 000 in addition to which there are 10 000 who find a subsidiary occupation here  Including the latter this gives a whole attorney of some kind to every 1 100 workers  irg cculists    Prirate  Income and Domeitlc  Service   In class D  Miscellaneous  there are six orders  In the first of these  No  60  Persons living on their income  an order which includes pensioners  scholarships holders  etc   the number has risen since 1921 in proportion to the general population  the proportion to the total of workers having risen from 13 to 14 per 10 000   131     \fPRIVATE INCOME   295  excluding 65 000 in 1931 who had some definite occupation as well  It may however be noted that the number of females returned in this order has fallen in absolute figures  though if to the 1931 total be added the total who returned living on their income as subsidiary to some other occupation  the 1921 total of females in this order  50 809  is almost equalled by the 50 535 obtained in 1931  This suggests that some of those who returned a private income as their means of subsistence in 1921 have this time retm ued some other occupation  perhaps domestic service  as their principal means of subsistence in 1931  It has already been pointed out that this order 51  Domesfic Service has been unnaturally swollen in 1931 by returns of females at the expense of other orders  in particular probably of agriculture  but no doubt also of others  including possibly not only those just referred to but also dancing girls and prostitutes  both of which categories show a noticeable decrease in 1931  Even the number of male domestic servants shows a remarkable increase since 1921  from 1 710 000 to 2 095 000  an increase of 22 percent  or  if working dependants be excluded in 1931  of 6 per cent  The apparent increase however in female domestic servants is by 971 per cent  from 822 000 to 8 804 000  Clearly tliis can only  be explained by  the resort to a return of domestic service as a substitute fora return of some other kind  and the 1931 figure that is really comparable with the 1921 return of female domestic servants is that of the 887 000 who have returned it as their principal occupation  this occupation being returned as dependent by the remaining 7 917 000  in addition to which 1 533 400 females have returned domestic service as a subsidiary occupation  The only other point to be noticed in this order is the increase in group 186  Private motor drivers and cleaners from 18 800 to 68 000  a rise consistent  vith that in groups 107 and 142 already noticed      Insufficiently  132  In order 52  which contains four gi oups of Insufficiently described occupations  only  one point calls for comment here and that is the disappearance of  some 70 000 women from group  Described  and Unproductive  Businessmen amd Contractors otherwise unsfccified  since 1921  Here again they  have probably gone to Order 51  which has formed a convenient receptacle for all sorts of women whose occupation is not easy  to define in precise terms  That the general increase in order 52 is in part due to prevailing unemploy ment has already been suggested in paragraph 119 above  There remains sub class XII euphemistically described as Unproductive ’  In this sub class Order 53  Ifimales of Jails  Asylums and Almshouses  shows a regrettable increase of 37 per cent   that is from 128 393 in 1921 to 176 128 in 1931  Of the latter figure approximately 140 000 are prisoners imdergoing rigorous imprisonment  but as the provinces and states in some cases misunderstoocl the instructions and amalgamated the figures of convicts sentenced to simple imprisonment with those sentenced to rigorous the figure can only be accepted with caution  In addition to the above there appear in the returns 238 my sterious persons who find a subsidiary occupation in being an inmate of some almshouse  jail  or perhaps more plausibly  for there is no Cat and Mouse act in force in India  asylum  On the other hand in Order 54  Beggars  Vagrants  Prostitutes  group 193  Be^yars and Vagrants shows a fall of 20 per cent  from 1 593 000 to 1 397 000  which latter figure includes the 115 000 odd who returned beggary as a subsidiary means of subsistence  while in group 194  Procurers and Prostitutes  there has been a fall in the returns of 23 per cent   from 94 000 to 72 500  the latter figure including those for whom this occupation affords only a subsidiary livelihood  How far this is a real decline and how far it is due to an increasing distaste for returning a disreputable occupation it is impossible to say  but perhaps the two alternatives are in either case symptomatic of the same tendency  and the existence of the one involves the other  at any rate sooner or later  The last group 195  Other unclassified iwn productive industries shovA s a slight decrease in the number of males returned  unless subsidiary  occupations are included  but an in explicably high increase of females entirely in the form of working dependants  The group includes among others a certain number of persons who returned their occupation as Congress worker but this can hardly account for those working dependants whose principals are apparently returned under some 1  88  Manufacturers   Occupatloiiia  ‘  ‘  ’  ‘  other occupation   Section hi     Occupation by Caste and Race  ^  133  Table XI contains some figures of certain castes by occupations  showing the numbers dealt wth  the numbers  following the traditional caste occupations  an J     Oceupatioa and Caste   \fCHAPTER Vin  OCCUPATION   296  the numbers followung other occupations  the latter classified on broad lines by This table was an optional table and was not compiled by all provinces  sub classes  and where compiled was not exhaustive  so that the figures compiled for the India table offer only samples  the method having been to compile it as far as possible for all castes for which figures were available and which were well distributed by provincial tables  omitting those castes tabulated for Table XI in only one or two  This table was omitted entirely in 1921 but it is of some importance as indicating the extent of the tendency of castes to abandon hereditary callings and take up others  In certain directions of course this tendency has long existed  Agriculture for instance is a respectable calling and it is one which at any rate can be conveniently combined wdth many caste occupations  and the tendency to substitute agriculture for other pursuits must be of very long standing and many castes whose names imply some other occupation are now mainly agricultural  Possibly many have always been so  for the typical Indian  fillage system  in which various occupational castes pnrsue their callings in a single village for the benefit of the whole village community  seems to be of comparatively late growth and is Indeed the Bengal possibly the result of deliberate administrative arrangements  Report for 1901 points out how in Orissa where a new village is formed the presence of the necessary occupational castes required to make the  ’illage self contained and self supporting is obtained by free grants of land known as chakra n jagir  On the other hand the Jatakas suggest a distribution of occupa tion by village  mentioning Such a distribution appears a village of wheelv Tights  a village of potters  etc  more primitive in type and would have contributed in no small degree to the original Functional societies of this kind are likely to stabilization of functional castes  the perpetuation of inherited aptitude and to favourable to been extremely have technique  processes and Such a distribution of function by villa ge  secretion of the is still found in Burma and in a very active form in the hill districts between Burma and Assam  particularly in the unadministered areas  provinces   j ‘  Apart from agriculture the abandonment of caste functions is operative in There is no tendency for instance particular directions to the exclusion of others  for other castes to encroach on the dhobi s monopoly of washing  though all castes aim at ent ‘ring the learned professions and in particular government service  and there is a similar tendency to give up caste callings for trade  The tendency to leave caste callings for learned professions is one which is making itself severely felt  by those castes  Brahmans and Kayasthas in particular  who have in the past held  They are being submitted to severe competition in a virtual monopoly of them  the special callings to which they have been accustomed to work for their livelihood  and the pinch is accentuated by the policy approved by Government of communal representation in Government service  a policy not confined to administrative posts but extended to clerical ones  and detrimental to those castes whose heredi ary function is clerical  and who have neither aptitude nor inclination for industry or trade  as well a s to the performance of the functions themselves   A general examination of the castes tabulated by occupation enables the     In the majority of cases about half position to be roughly summarized as follows the males tabulated retain their traditional occupation and varying numbers up to     but rarely exceeding  a quarter  have other subsidiary occupations  About a quarter or less of the half that have abandoned their hereditary occupations as their principal means of Nubsistence retain them as subsidiary  One or two exceptions Of the   hamar s hardly more than one in thirteen return their are worth stating  traditional occupation as the principal means of subsistence and only one in 40 as the subsidiary means  The Bhats again form a similar exception and not unnaturally  as the demand for genealogists is probably less than that for tanners and their occupation as heralds is one of the past entirely  In the case of Jhinwars again the greater decrease of the numbers following their traditional occupation is the natural corollary of the decline in the number of palki owners and bearers already noticed in regard to the figures of group 109 in Order 20  Transport by Road   while the extremely limited extent to which the mali pursues his hereditary calling of hardener is perhaps dictated by the limited numbers of persons who can afford to° employ gardeners  On the other hand the agricultural communities of Jat and Kurmi have not gone nearly so far as to abandon their hereditary occupation to the Turning to the callings adopted  agriculture is easily extent of 50 per cent  the most popular  though in lu stry  trarle and transport claim fair numbers and  \f      OCCUPATION AND CASTE   297  many appear as

concerning the definitions of the three terms  ‘Earner’  Working Dependant and Non Working Dependant’  Before definitely ascribing the differences in the ratios to this reason  it is as well to remember that they are  influenced not only by economic conditions due to environment and locality  but also by the proportions of the sexes and the age constitution of the population when set down ‘  ’  ‘  in figures for 1 000 persons  For the purpose of this enquiry it will suffice to examine the figures for males only and to start by assuming that all males aged under 10 years and over 60 are nonworking dependants  This assumption as regards those aged over 60 is perhaps somewhat arbitrary but it provides a basis for certain deductions as will be seen hereafter   Starting from the South  we get from Imperial Table VII the age constitution of males among 1 000 persons in Travancore and Madras to be as shown in the following statements  Following  the assumption referred to above  all males aged under 10 and over 60 provides the majority of non  working dependants supplemented where necessary by the requisite number of those aged 10 15  The remainder of those so aged are then placed in the categories of Working Dependants and Earners to the extent required leaving all those aged 15 to 20 in the category of     Earners wherever possible  Travancore  Density 668   Earners   252  Non  Working Dei endants     32  Working Dependants    219  Earners   503  503  Now there are in this State 503 males in every 1 000 persons in the population  and it is unlikely that nearly one third of those aged from 15 to 20 are non  working dependants  In this densely populated and prosperous State it is far more probable that the older males give up leading an aptive life before they are aged 60 and that the majority of the male working dependants are 20 are earners  leaving 49 out of 221 aged from lads aged from 10 15  that all aged from 15 20 60 to retire from active life and free to join the ranks of the non working dependants            The figures for the Madras Presidency present somewhat similar features  but here the male ratio in 1 000 persons is 494  i e   9 less than in Travancore   0 10 136        178 4 23 201 Non Working Dependants   Madras Density 328   din   3   15 2020 60 233 60         20  20 Working Dependants   273 273 Earners    23  over   494  494  • This is  I think  most onlikely     J  H   t£   \f   APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VUI   322  It is unlikely that as many as 42 out of 59 of those  aged 10   15 are non working dependants   The probability is that all the 20 Working Dependants are furnished by this group and that of the remaining 39 only a few of the younger ones are non workers and that quite 25 are earners  Pursuing this assumption  we therefore find that the 273 Earners consist of 25 who are aged 10  15  43 aged 15 20 and 205 aged 20 60  This leaves the 28 older males of this latter age group free to join the non  working category  The constitution would then be something like     this     0 10  136    150 r28 l 23 201   20   I  r 14J    20 L251  273 15 20   43 r205j 20 60  233 j 28 1  10 15  59 ^   273  N  W  D   W  D  Earners   L 1  60     23  over   494  494  These figures for the South of India lead one to the conclusions that a man’s working life is over before the age of 60 is reached owing to a sufficiency of younger men to take up the responsibilities of earners   For conditions in the central areas of the Continent  the figures for Gwalior and Baroda Bearing in mmd that the male ratios in 1 000 persons are 530

and Travancore  of the real distribution of literacy  as a f Including Aden  literacy which is confined to males is apt to be of rather a special nature  and  except in those castes or classes in which male literacy and learning is a natural heritage or a religious necessity  is apt to be a mere economic implement necessary to business  a means of livelihood  a political weapon  or useful for intercourse with the external world  but of little value for          roughly  125 125     ‘ I        own sake  It is not perhaps until literacy becomes a domestic acquisition taken for granted among

the Police Department on a salary of Rs  10 to Rs  12 per month and are held fortunate in getting employment at all  On the other hand there is no falling off in the higher secondary classes but a continued increase  which he The falling off in ascribes to such pupils having gone too far to withdraw  primary education he rightly regards as a bad sign  and he argues the necessity However that may be  the of completely recasting the educational system  distribution of male literacy shows some divergence from that of general literacy  as may be seen in the accompanying diagram in which provinces and states are arranged in order of general literacy but in which male and female literacy are taken separately for graphic representation   In the relative position of provinces and states in order of literacy there is little change during the decade  Cochin State  in spite of a very rapid growth in population  has been able to do more than keep pace with that growth  in spite of having Burma easily maintains her lead  for there literacy started with a very high ratio  even if not of a very high order  is a habit  traditional in both sexes and all classes  both boys and girls being taught in the monasteries of which almost every Burman No need perhaps for compulsory education here  In village has at least one  India however it had been introduced by 1930 in 133 urban areas and in 3 137 rural areas of which 2 303 are in the Punjab  though apparently with no very  marked success  138  It is a commonplace that literacy is much more prevalent in towns than in the country  as both the need for it and the opportunities of acquiring it are Thus an examination of the 34 cities tabulated in Table XIII shows greater  total population the proportion literate per 1 000 is 348 males and 149 of the that females as compared to 133 and 25 respectively in India as a whole  A reference may also be made in this respect to the table in paragraph 41 of chapter II  There is naturally a still greater contrast in literacy in English  the figures for the same 34 cities being 1 473 males literate in English per 10 000 of the total population and 434 females  as compared to 181 and 23 re spectively for the whole of India  139  The distribution of hteracy among females has already been indicated when dealing with the distribution of literacy generally  and a reference to the diagram above will show that the extent of literacy among women is not necessarily determined by its extent among Total number of literate females in  men  but  1921     1931   Western  2 782 213

are found in a vicious circle  since the early age of marriages IV 93 234 105 663 77 478 prevents the growth of female literacy  while the absence of female literacy seems largely responsible for the absence of any general change in the early age of marriage  Burma and the Malabar Coast are the two exceptions and in Cochin State an increasing tendency is reported for women to seek careers of their own in preference to marriage at all For the extent of female literacy in different comn  unities and in different castes  a reference may be made to the marginal tables given in paragraphs 140 and

having    LITERACY PER MILLE AGED 5 AND OVER IN MAIN COMMUNITIES   been based on racial instead of religious groups in Burma the figures of literacy by religion are to this extent discrepant with those of last census as the latte^ included Hindus  Mushms  etc   in Burma  whereas the present ones are confined to India proper and the figures for Burma are not distinguished by religion except This being so it has been thought better here in the case of Hindus and Mushms  as elsewhere to show Burma as a single unit in the subsidiary tables in this chapter   \f329  LITERACY BY COMMUNITY   it

Punjab in 1921 wrote of their educational stagnation  This time they easily lead in rate of increase except among w omen  where they are second to the Jains  It is hardly necessary to point out that the high standard of literacy among Parsis  Jews and Jains is partly due to the fact that they are mainly composed  of trading classes for whom literacy is essential  and that where literacy is so general as  it is among the Parsis  for instance  the rate of growth per mille is not strictly comparable  to the rate of growth in a comparatively illiterate comAt the same time it is noteworthy that in Burma where the munity  prevalence of literacy is much greater than in any Indian communities except Parsis and Jains the rate of increase should be as high as 51 per mille for the total population

The proportionate figures for the same castes are given with reference to locality in subsidiary table V at the end of this chapter where comparative figures for 1921 are available  Those with a high

provinces and 19 India are detailed in the appendix on the Exterior Castes at the end of this volume  The primitive tribes are very many of them greatly handicapped in the acquisition of literacy by the fact that they are so often given their primary education in a language which is not theit own  This is not the case in Assam  where the local vernacular is usually used in primary schools in hill districts  a policy the results of which are reflected in the literacy of the Lusheis and Khasis if the Nagas are backward it is to be put do’wn largely to the incredibly polyglot nature of their habitat where there are as many vernaculars in a small area as will be foxmd in the rest of India outside Assam and Burma  Generally ho’^  ever the policy seems to be to use the vernacular of the adjacent plains for the primary instruction of hill tribes  and the backwardness of the Santals  for instance  in literacy is attributed by Mr  P  0  Bodding  the best authority on that tribe  to that policy  As regards the difficulties in the way of acquisition of literacy by the depressed classes reference may be made to Appendix I to this volume  on the Exterior Castes  North West Frontier Proving   15 15 15 14  Coorg                    142 In any comparison between literacy in 1931 and in 1921 there is one factor that has to be borne in mind wffiich has already been examined in Chapter VI  The number of literates at any given and that is the method of sorting by age  year will not necessarily be proportional to the total number of that year living  and when the years are grouped the upper limit of any group wdll contain a higher proportion of literates than the lower until majority is reached  The method of sorting therefore will exclude from the group 5 to 10 a certain number who have appeared in that group in 1921  Some of these wdll be correctly excluded owning to the preference for the digit 5 Avhich then depleted in some degree the 4 A^ear group in favour of the higher age  but probably more than the correct number Avill be excluded  This matters little enough as far as real literacy is concerned  as literaoA^ at the age of 5 is only nominal  but the comparatiAm Amlues aauII suffer a little  the actual position as compared to 1921 being really a little better than the bare figures The comparable value of the other figures of literacy by age aaoII indicate  similarly be slightly impaired in regard to 1921  but the total figure of literacy of course only loses by the small number unduly excluded from the group 5  10 to the group 0 5 and this number can 2  robably be ignored for practical purposes Subj ect  Literacy                 Literacy per mille   „     1921   1931   Aged   5 10  Females   29  10 28 36  no  10 15 15 20 20 and over  Males      174

 LITERACY   females  In the lowest age group the numbers literate have doubled  and the loss in the 10 15 group is only 1 per mille in males  females gaining by 6 per mill e  In 1921 also it was this group which showed the lowest ratio of increase over 1911  After group 5 10  group 15 20 shows the next highest increase  It is this group which is usually regarded as most indicative of the growth of literacy  and the lower ratio of the subsequent group is in accordance with normal expectations  Obviously however this need not be necessarily or permanently the case  since once literacy becomes general the reduction in literacy aged 20 and over will depend on the relative proportion of literate to illiterate deaths and on the extent to which literacy is lost  Generally speaking it seems likely that the average literate leads a life less exposed to casual dangers than the average ilhterate does  while there is less tendency to lose literacy if its use is involved in the calling pursued  It is perhaps natural therefore that among Parsis  the most longlived community in India  and also one which is mostly engaged in trade and unlikely to suffer from loss of literacy  the ratio of literacy should be even higher above the age of 20 than it is from 15 to 20  and the same considerations may explain the same phenomenon among male Jews  It is also to be seen however among Burmese and among Indian Buddhists  vide Subsidiary Table I at the end of this chapter   and the explanations suggested in the India Report 1911 do not seem to account for this satisfactorily  Possibly the case of Burma is met by the fact that literacy is general enough among males to prevent any excess in the ratio literate from 15 to 20  but this explanation cannot be applied to Indian Buddhists         Literacy In  EnglUb      143 Literacy m English has increased  that is in ratio to the numbers of the community  among all communities except Christians  where it has failed to keep pace with the growth in numbers  Sikhs have shown the most rapid increase  hav   ing very nearly doubled their ratio during the decade  the next highest proportional increase being among Muslims  Subsidiary Table I shows the distribution of literacy  among conmiunities  Subsidiary Table IV shows it by age  sex and and gives comparative figures for 1921 and 1911  The proportional figures are too small to show conveniently per 1  000  so figures of literacy in English are given per 10 000 of the population aged 5 and over  The Parsis have 5 041  Jews 2 630  Christians 919   Jains 306  Sikhs 151  Indian

The figures for Baluchistan are fictitious for the reasons given in paragraph 137 above Delhi and Ajmer Merwara show high figures on account As pointed out in paragraph 13g of the very high proportion of urban population  in English pro  ince      above  literacy in English is particularly high in cities on account of the greater opportunities for its acquisition and its greater economic value in use  The high figures of the Andamans and Nicobars are Literate in English per 10 000 of population   Caste   also  more or less artificial   Cochin State  really leads in literacy in English wth 307

given in paragraph 141 above   144     It  was suggested when the advent Committee was at hand in  of the Franchise  1931 that figures  should be obtained at the census of all persons who had reached the leaving  standard of primary schools  since such statistiCvS would be useful if any decision were made to base the franchise on some such qualification  It was however found impossible to devise any uniform definition of the necessary’ standard which could be  \f            LITERACY FOR FRANCHISE   333  school leaving certificate  or another of a similar description  apphed as a test oi hteracy would leave unqualified a large number of persons who are literate but Some will have left school before such certificates were possess no such certificate  given at all others will have neglected to sit for the examination others again will have acquired hteracy by private tuition  at a private institution  or in the course of business  It is very doubtful therefore if such a test could conveniently be made use of in determining the quahfication for franchise  Many provinces and states however did undertake an enquiry of this kind and the results are referred to in the provincial reports        It is perhaps worth while in this connection to reproduce here an interesting The Census Superintendent paragraph from the Central Provinces Report   writes     “ It seems

from the statistics of 1931  The growth of the strength of the non Brahmin party is obvious  The inadequate representation of the aboriginal tribes is most striking   The strongest elements purely from the point of view of caste are the Brahmins  Banias and Marathas and Kunbis  Of these  the Maratha Brahmins and the Marathas and Kunbis each represent communities closely bound by caste  customs

that 74 per cent  of the pupils are in primary schools  a decline of 2 per cent  in the proportion of primary pupils during the decade  so that the already unduly low proportion of primary to secondary education appeai ed to be falling instead of rising  This aspect of the relation between  the tw o is indicated by the comparative rates of growth  vide Subsidiary Table VII at the end of this chapter   MTiile since 1901 the number of primary schools has increased by 110 per cent   those of secondary schools have increased by 151 per cent  and those of colleges by 71 per cent  again since 1921 the growth in the number of primary schools has been 28 per cent  only  W hereas secondary schools and colleges have increased by 51 per cent  and 44 per cent  respectively  This point is further emphasised by the statement of expenditure  About half the money spent on education is contributed by Government  and of the w hole amount  after the exclusion of Direction  Inspection  Buildings  Universities  Board s  Special Schools  and Miscellaneous  we find that Rs  6 82 07 867 are  spent on primary education as compared to Rs  9 45 23 607 on secondary  Admittedly primary education cannot be extended without spending    money on secondary education  but the sums spent on the latter and the number of pupils under secondary instruction  appear disproportionately high in view of  \f          COMPAEISON WITH RETURNS OF THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT   335  the large illiterate population  It has been estimated that about two thirds of the villages in India have no schools  and for the 500 000 census villages in British territory the Education Department figures show little over 200 000 recognised schools  while the addition of all unrecognised rural schools fails to bring the total to 230 000  The average cost per pupil in all recognised institutions worked out at just over Rs  23 for 1930  but a separate analysis of the cost of primary and secondary pupils respectively gaveRs  8 5 5 andRs  179 4 3 as the cost of each primary and each secondary male pupil for that year  and Rs  10 3 6 and Rs  467 3 5 respectively as the corresponding costs of each female pupil  vide Education in India  1929 1930   The high cost of girl pupils is no doubt due in a great degree to their comparative paucity  and is to that extent unavoidable  but the figures do suggest that the amount spent on secondary education is disproportionate to that sj ent on primary  The reason is simple enough  As a result of the caste system there is an insistent demand for education on the part of those castes who have been accustomed to look to literacy to provide them with a livelihood  and their tendency under competition is to demand higher education  On the other hand there is no widespread demand among other castes for education at all  and this is illustrated by the tremendous wastage in primary schools  This amounts to two thirds of the total in the case of boys and a great deal more than that in the case of girls  who are apt to leave school when they are married  This wastage again explains the inordinate excess of No  of pupils  1931  per 1 000 of  Pro vine

perhaps as those of effec   which really about 20 years  and if they appear unduly low when compared tive literacy   only begins  to  the  at  figures  of  pupils  under instruction  this must be put down to the wastage already mentioned which involves a discard of at least two thirds of the primary pupils  that is of a half of the total number of pupils  Burma is of course exceptional as most of her literacy is obtained in village monasteries and not through the Education Department  The high figure of Delhi is no doubt due in part to its being mainly an urban area and in part to the concentration there of minister al officers of Government and their families   The Education Department consider that four years at school is required to give permanent literacy  and that the number of literates turned out in any vear can therefore be gauged by the number of No  of class pupils reading in Class lY in that vear  IV pupils in Year  British India   635 604 646 962 672 412 668 345

quarters it was decided to attempt at    the 1931 census to obtain figures of the educated unemployed generally believed to be exceedingly high  The general schedule was already inconveniently crowded  and as the return was intended to touch only those who were fully literate a separate schedule was prepared to be filled in by the enumerated himself and not by the enumerator  The instructions on the form employed stated that the information was required in the interest of the public  of the State and of the unemployed themselves  and it might have been anticipated that a general response would have been  \f                    EDUCATED UNEMPLOYED   337  made to tins effort to obtain information   The attempt was however a failure  as though many forms were issued very few were filled in and returned to the enumerators  and although some provinces and states obtained figures which they considered were worth incorporating in their statistical tables  the results for India as a whole were so unsatisfactory that the figures must have been misleading if credited  and it was decided to omit them from part II of the India volume  Such as they are  they are included in this chapter  but the degree of their probable imderstatement may be inferred by a comparison of the figures with those obtainable from the Education Department  The latter showed that there were  in 1930  25 716 candidates who passed for matriculation  13 633 who passed the Intermediate Arts or Science examination  9 300 who passed examinations for their B  A  or B  Sc   and 1 426 who passed examinations for their M  A  or M  Sc   a total of over 50 000 of whom over 10 000 were graduates  and the number of graduates turned out annually in India from 1921 onwards has not been less than 7 000 and has at least twice been over 10 000  making over 55 000 graduates alone between 1921 and 1930  apart from those who have failed to graduate in comparison vfith this the 15 000 odd returned as unemployed  most of whom were only matriculates  can hardly be regarded as affording a satisfactory explanation of the outcry there is about the lack of employment for the educated or the vast number of

be found in Rangoon  The reason given for theh failm e to make the return was that they feared use would be made of it to repatriate to India those who were without employment  In Bengal the reason alleged was a fear on the part of the unemployed hliadralok that all that was wanted was a hst of them for the pohce as political suspects  while another rumour accused the Government of trying to win over the In unemployed from the congress party by false hopes of employment  Madras the attitude of the recipient of the unemployment schedule was described as “ You will not give me employment  why should I fill up yom‘ schedule   ” and it seems likely that this feeling  together with a dishke of admitting failure to have foimd employment and general apathy towards the census is to be taken as the most common cause of the schedule’s failure  This failure is not only indicative of the uselessness of expecting to obtain a voluntary return of information failure to comply with which involves no penalty  but a warning against attempts to collect special information on separate schedules returned by the individual as distinct from information collected by an enumerator who retains the schedule hunself throughout the proceedings  In connection with educated unemployment and in ‘explanation of what he aptly labels the cacoethes  niatriculandi the Census Superintendent for Assam quotes the following passage from a note written by Mr  Cunningham  many years Director of Public Instruction in Assam  for the Calcutta University Commission in 1917  and it is still true to day    “ There is a constant conflict in educational policy between the Government and people the one desiring to improve the standard of education  the other crying on behah of the hungry who are not fed  for the relaxation of standards and the wider spread of education  good or bad  The privileged classes do not take to commerce or industry  the unprivileged follow the lead of the privileged  It has been said that in these parts the social order is a despotism of caste tempered by matriculation  It is only by matriculating and taking the part in the after life which has been reserved for those who have matriculated that the lower castes can raise themselves to consideration  It is only so that they can raise a representation strong enough to fight for their social and political interests and it is only by education that the privileged classes can qualify themselves to oppose effectively the conservatism of Government  On both hands this literary education is what every man desires  And if new ways are opened which lead to profit  the best amongst the lower classes will still press forward  undiverted  to the imiversity unless the new employment is socially esteemed  and certificated by the fact that ” the bhadralog compete for it     The Census Superintendent himself sums up the position as follows     Matriculation has in fact assumed much the same importance in the social sphere as a public school education has done in England   man  The ambition to  ‘  make a gentle   of their son is not confined to the parents of the lower classes of any  one country and in Assam this takes the form of matriculation and a job which does not involve manual labour  The respectability of a community in Assam  can  in fact  be generally measured by the number of persons belonging to that community ” who are in Government service   \f             ^     339  SUBSIDIARY TABLES   SUBSIDIARY TABLE 1  Literacy by Age  Sex and Religion Number per 10 000  Number per mille  aged 5 and over who

Total  \fCHAPTER X  Lrangtia^e  Section i  The Returns  Eztenfion of the language return   147  For the return of language in the 1931 census two cokunns were providedone for the speakers of mother  tongue  and the other for any language or languages habitually spoken  in addition to the mother tongue  in daily or domestic life  Infants and deaf and dumb persons were to be credited with  the same language as their mothers  The distribution and classification of Indian languages has been so exhaustively dealt with in the Linguistic Surv^ey of India  the very important introductory volume to which appeared as recently as 1927  that little remains for a census to do with regard to the main languages of the country beyond recording their corresponding increase and decrease  since the area of any given tongue is hardly ever stable  In one respect  however  existing information was lacking and that was the extent of the overlap of different languages in the numberless areas in which two or more co exist  It is not suggested that this overlap is a permanent feature  and that areas speaking two languages at present will necessarily continue to do so in perpetuity  but in view of the not unreasonable desire of many Indians for a redistribution of provinces on a linguistic basis  as well as of the possibility of extensions of franchise to very considerable populations speaking some tribal language as their mother tongue  to say nothing of the desirabdity of starting all primary education in the real language of the child to be taught  the record of this overlap has more than a purely academic interest  Moreover  apart from linguistics  the extent of the survival of tribal languages is a better index than that of the survi  al of tribal religion to the social cohesion of the tribe  smce the test of language is easier and more definite than that of religion where the borderland of Hinduism is often vague and obscure  As a matter of fact the material collected of the distribution of mother tongue and subsidiary languages in Orissa  and the coasts thereof was requisitioned by the Orissa Boundary Committee before it had been extracted from the schedules  and it was only by working himself and his staff to the verge of collapse that the Buperindendent of Census Operations in Madras was able to provide adequate data in time for the Committee to use it   irredenta  Subsidiary  language and Orissa boundaries   148  In the case of Orissa unfortunately the very facts which the census sched ule was designed to ekeit operated towards impairing its value  This was on account of the stupid and unintelligent propaganda which was deliberatelv directed to misrepresent as Oriya what was not Oriya  or as non Oriya what was  The resultof this propaganda was the sort of foolishness which made both enumerated and enumerator plump for one language  If a man spoke Oriya as an alternative language with  say  Bengali as his mother tongue he would ret urn his mothertongue as Bengak and perversely return Bengali again in the subsidiary column for fear of giving support to the Oriya case  Vice versa Oriya speakers equally at home in Telugu would conceal the fact by returning Oriya in both columns  Of the various agitators the Oriyas were easily the worst  So hi»h did feekngrun in the Orissa boundaries of Madras that special f fficers had to be appointed to superintend enumeration and abstraction  Nevertheless the retiu n of subsidiary language  incomplete as it was  made it possible to indicate clearly enough the debatable areas where two lanj uages were spoken and must have been of very considerable value to the Boundary Committee  The general percentage increase in Oriya speakers since 1921 is in close relation to the average increase in population  and the consistency of the language returns in Ganjam as compared with those of previous censuses  es cepting always that of 1901  indicates their general acTotal Number Percentag curacy

CLASSIFICATION      349  population of the Ganjam plains  to which the figures relate  as compared to the 52 6 per cent  whose mother  tongue it is  but it is probable that there has been some understatement both of Oriya and of Telugu in the return of subsidiary The inaccuracy of the 1901 language  as Oriya Telugu bilinguahsm is extensive  figure was recognised at the time  and actually during the coarse of compilation a reference was made to the Census Superintendent as to the return of Reddikis  a Telugu caste  as Oriya speakers  The compilation was however contmued in accordance with the return in the schedule  The Madras Government had a special enquiry made in 1904 as to the language returns of 1901 and reported that the inaccuracy of the census figures in that year was due to the desire of Telugus to participate in the special advantages given to encourage the education of Oriyas to the behef that it was easier for Oriyas to obtain Government service than for Telugus and to the fact that there were more Oriya enumerators than Telugu  that they would ask their questions in Oriya  and would probably put down as Oriya speaking all who answered in that language  Ganjam is predominantly bilingual and the return of subsidiary language was first introduced in 1931  So deep does bilingualism go in parts of Ganjam that from very infancy many grow up speaking both Oriya and Telugu and are so much at home in both that they cannot tell which to return as their mother tongue  Some officers unfamihar with this phenomenon found difficulty in appreciating the fact that small children can be bilingual  and rejected returns of a subsidiary language under the age at which they considered it possible for a child to have learned a second one thoroughly  but in point of fact it is perfectly possible for a child to be bilingual from his first learning to speak  and the phenomenon is famihar in some parts of India where marriages between persons of different hnguistic groups are coimnon  The late Khan of Kalat spoke Brahui to his mother and Balochi to his father from infancy  and children lisping in two radically different tongues are common enough in the hills of Assam     and about Orissa the subsidiary language return by immediate politics  though not always free from the case of Bhopal State  where Urdu was returned “ in  149 Elsewhere than    in  w^as fortunately not coloured political bias  as in  in order to give effect to a sentiment dehberate disregard of the actual facts li^ing in that State ought to have the peculiarly Hindus as well as MusUms that Mushm variety of Hindustani as their mother tongue instead of Rajasthani and even instead of Gondi  A similar sentiment caused Muslims in many parts of India to return Urdu  Hindustani  as their mother tongue and the local vernacular as their subsidiary language though the precise opposite was the real fact and the same sort of feeling was at work in the case of some Gonds who  considering Gondi of inferior social reputation  returned Halbi  a Marathi dialect  as their mother tongue  giving Gondi  if at all  as subsidiary  In fact Mr  Grigson  when Administrator in Bastar State in 19 30  stated that it was common for Gonds to affirm in court that they knew no language but Halbi  when as a matter of fact their wives and mothers coming to give evidence would be found to understand no tongue but Gondi  on which husbands and sons wmuld admit that they did speak Gondi in their homes  The first stage in the disappearance of any language is the use of another as well in ordinary daily intercourse  and in cases of this kind it is probable that the provision for the return of a second language has extended the area of record of many of the hill and jungle languages now in the process of becoming submerged  a process likely to be much accelerated by the ubiquitous It has proved impossible to plot this overlap increase of easy communications  with precise reference to the numbers involved on a scale small enough to reproduce as an all India map for this volume  Th^ linguistic map therefore which accompanies this report deals only with the distribution of mother tongues  and for detailed information as to subsidiary languages the student is referred to the various provincial reports in all of which  except in that for the United Provinces  where Hindustani alone is spoken  will be found a map showing the distribution by population figures not only of mother tongue but of the actual numbers speaking various subsidiary languages in each district and in some cases in even smaller units  In the provincial volumes  Table XV  ii  will be found the details of subsidiary languages by the smallest territorial units for which it was practicable to give them where such languages were not evenly distributed over a A summary of this information wall be found in Table district or larger area     Bilinguallsnu  \f350  CHAPTER X    SLANGUAGE   XV Changes in clasaiBcation    ii   in part ii of this volume and in the corresponding subsidiaiy table at the end of this chapter  150 A few alterations of minor importance have been made in the classification India thus appears with 225 of languages as compared with that of 1921  instead of 222 languages although the Tibeto Burman Sub family is credited    with only 128 instead of 134 languages  This reduction of six  increased to seven by the omission of unspecified Pahari  is more than balanced by an addition of one to the Eranian branch Persian  a dialect of which is the mother tongue of a number of villages in Baluchistan  having here been added to the vernaculars of India of one to the Dardic branch  that is of Bashgah in the Kafir group which did not appear at all in 1921 of one to the southern group of the IndoAryan branch  Konkani beiug treated as a separate language and not  as in 1921  as a dialect of Marathi and of seven to the unclassed languages  Burushaski appearing for the first time  Andamanese being shown as two languages instead of one  since the language of the Jarawas  Sentmelese and Onges differs much from that of the Great Andaman coast tribes   and the unclassed Gipsy tongues appearing as six instead of one  though there has been no change in nomenclature or In the case however of classification except that they are not pooled as in 1921  the Tibeto Burman languages there are changes in grouping and nomenclature which need to be stated  In the Bodo group the speakers of the language shown in 1921 as “ Tipara or Mrung ” have been returned partly under the same head and partly under the term Tsakchip in the Old Kuki sub group of the Kuki Chin group  In the Xaga group Khoirao and Marami have been merged in IMemi   “Sopvoma or Mao ” of 1921   and Chang  the cis frontier speakers of which are very few  in the new terra Other Eastern Naga languages  which includes also Phom and some trans frontier languages spoken by casual individuals found inside the frontier at census time  ilikir has been put in a group by itself  as besides having affinities to the Kachha Xaga and Kabui languages it has strong affinities to the Bodo tongues and some to the Kuki ones  Maring has also been omitted from the Naga  Kuki sub gioup and shown in the Old Kuki sub group of the Kuki Chin group  with which it seems to have at least as much affinity as with the Naga  In the Kuki Chin group there have been changes of nomenclature and amalgamation resulting in the disappearance from the list of Purum  Hiroi Lamgang  Chote  Vaiphei  Kamhow  Laiyo  Kwingly  Yokwa  Kaungtso  Kwelshin  Hualngo  Kyaw and Taungtha  and in the addition of Pankhu  Chinbok  Chinnie  Bongtu and Tsakchip as well as of iMaiing transferred from the Naga group  Sokte now includes Kamhow  Thado includes Jangsen  Lai includes Kaungtso  Kwangii  Kwelshin  Tlangtlang  Laiyo and Yokwa  and Tashon includes Hualngo  The Man and Karen languages probably have affinity with the Mon Khmer  with which indeed they were actually classified in 1911  but they are also reported to have Tai characteristics and the combination may be due to contact or to the amalgamation of tribes  They have been associated this time for convenience with the Tibeto Chinese family  as Przyluski treats them as affiliated to the Tai  Information on these and on the other groups of Burma languages is still very scanty as the Linguistic Survey of Burma has never been carried out  Among the foreign languages  C  Languages of Europe  is included a number of persons who returned their mother tongue as “ Swiss”  This however is not a new international language  but appears to be a relic of war time mentality and an euphemism accordingly to which category they have been added in the detailed table  From for German somewhat similar motives  perhaps  Flemish seems to have been returned as                 Belgian ”   Some slight alterations in tlio classification adopted in provincial and state reports have been made in the India tables  The speakers of Palaung  842  and Pale  114  returned from the Chittagong Hill Tracts  Tripura State and elsewhere in Bengal cannot apparently be correct  as all the Palaungs are located I have therefore no doubt whatever in the Shan States to the east of Burma  that Palaung should have been clasvsified as Palaing  the name of a KukiChin clan ill the area from which the returns are macle  Pale is more doubtful  ^there is certainly one called Palow It may be the name of another clan or it may be a return of Pali made by Buddhist priests in the spirit that provokes many returns of Sanskrit by learned Hindus or of Arabic by Muslims in anv case it is moat unlikely to be the Pale of the Palaung Wa country            \f    Wr  m     W  8¥

survival or displacement is of such interest  at any rate in several provinces  that no justification is recmired for quoting here at length from the provincial reports to v ’hieh reference must be niacle for details  The Census Superintendent for the United Provinces draws attention to the disaju earance of gipsy languages “ These g  psy languages are dying out in this proviiiee  Thc«e wandering tribes are taking to a more settled manner of livina  eultivation and the like  and with this change comes the need to use the language of their neighbours  As a result the majority of the present members of these tribes have never learnt these dialects  but speak from their youth some form even those who returned a gj psy language as mother tongue or other of Hindustani    in every case returned Hindustani as subsidiar   language ”  And  the  Census Superintendent of Mysore Stcto reports precisely the same Of tribal languages in Ccrntral India the Census Superintendent

Whether the Bhil had a language of his own we do not know  Probably the basis of his language was Munda but his present language is throughly overlaid with an Aryan The Gondi  so called  of Rewa is

valley have practically abandoned their language and speak Malvi ” For the tribes in Baxvda the Census Commissioner for that State points out that where the members of a tribe have no economic

is econcmic independence with a consequent social consciousness the tribal language survives Hinduization and value is attached to its retention  This helps to explain the obvious vitality as for instance by the Chodhras  of tribal languages in eastern India in spite of the rapid Hinduization of the past This vitalitv is on the whole pronounced in the Central Provinces  in decade  Bil lar and Orissa  in Bengal and in Assam  though there are one or two exceptions At the same time bilingualism is on the increase and in each of these provinces  The Census there can be little doubt of the ultimate fate of these tribal languages   Superintendent for the Central Provinces writes     “ In border areas poly linguism is in fact frequently encountered  A weU known  but humble  Gond shikari in south Chanda can speak and understand Hindi  Telugu  Gondi and wherever a tribal language Marathi  and such cases are by no means exceptional is spoken  the great majority of the adult men using it  and a large proportion of the adult women  are bi hngual  So faithfully indeed is this fact accepted that in Seoni district it was found that among the Gonds infants in arms were being recorded as bi hngual ”    Nevertheless of the tribal languages themselves he finds that     “ Kherwari was the onl   non  Aryan language for which numbers substantially below those  In fact the apparent fall in 1921 of those speaking almost aU tribal of 1911 were returned  languages must evidently be attributed to the influenza epidemic  for it can be proved from the figures of the 1931 Census that  although the danger of their displacement is obvious  the actual In the first state of affairs has not really been changing for many years past place  except for Korku  the Munda languages have either disappeared or are  it seems  in process of disappearance in this province  Of 84 971 Sawara or Saonrs enumerated not a single one returned the tribal language  There is no doubt that the Sawaras of Chhattisgarh and the territories outside the Central Provinces adjoining it are the same as the isolated tribe known some ethnologists have insisted that Korwas as Saonrs in Saugor and Damoh and Korkus are branches of the same tribe  If this is accepted the concentration of the Saonrs in the forests of the Yindhyan foothills  far from the Sawaras of Chhattisgarh  and the Korkus in the Mahadeo hills and the Melghat  far from the Korwas of the Chhota Nagpur plateau irresistibly suggests the withdrawal of those who spoke Munda languages in the first instance into the remote and isolated tracts of the province before the approach of Dravidian and Aryan The Jlunda elements which remained in the local language in the open tracts merglanguages  ed into mixed jargons  Even in the hills Sawara also disappeared  Of the others Korku  which is still  spoken among themselves by the greater number of the members of the tribe  Koiwa  Kharia and Gadaba alone survive  Gadaba the mother tongue of a handful of people in Bastar State numbering not more than 40U was returned by slightly more than that number of people at the Census  Sir George Grierson’s remarks regarding NihaH  classed as a dialect of Korku  are relevant in connection with this discussion  Mentioning that there are many instances of tribes which even in historic times have abandoned one language and taken to another he wrote    “  A striking examiple is afforded by the tribe of Nahals in the Central Provinces   These  people appear to have originally spoken a Munda language akin to Korku  It came rmder Dravidian influence and has become a mixed form of speech  half Munda and half Dravidian  This in its turn has fallen under the spell of Arjmn tongues  and is now in fair way to becoming an  Aryan language   If we were to judge by language a hundred years ago we should have called  the tribe Munda ”  Korku itself was returned as their mother tongue by 161 975 members of the tribe out of a total population of 170 616  the corresponding figures having been 112 194  and 140 440 in It is to be observed that of these  54 716 males and 50 974 females speak the language 1921  On the other hand the of the tract in which they reside as subsidiary to their mother tongue  number of persons returning mother tongiie Hindi or Marathi and sul sidiary language Korku was negligible  Apart from the few tribc s which still speak Munda or Dravidian languages there are a  number speaking either Aiyan dialects  distinguished by the name s of the tribes themselves or else the language of the tract in which they are found  Whether the original language of For instance Bhili these tribes was Munda or Dravidian it is generally impossible to trace  while the Karnars  Bhatras  and Halbas is now classed as a language of the Aiyan sub family On the other hand the Baigas  a t  pical forest people all speak dialects of Ar  an languages  numbering 37 686 in the province  have now really no language of their own  Baigani returned by 3 641 persons almost all in Balaghat  is merely a broken dialect of Chhattisgarhi  Others    who have lost their original language  whatever it was  are Bhumhars  Binfhwars  Kofis  Eautias  Kawars and Pandos   Binjhwari  returned by 2 339 speakers in Raipur and Surguja  \f   SURVIVAL OF TRIBAL LANGUAGES   353  Bhuihari  spoken by 28 persons in Korea  and sub dialect of Cbhattisgarhi  Pando  by 502 in Udaipur  have been identified by Eai Bahadur Hiralal to be broken dialects  Is recognized as a  of Cbhattisgarhi  It is interesting to notice that  among these tribes which have assimilated Aryan language  are some  if not all  of those regarded as the true aboriginals or autochthonoi of the Eastern Central Provinces for instance the Binjhwars  the Kamars and the Baigas  The Gonds  Halbas     and others have been classed as semi aboriginals  probably outsiders who have been domiciled in the province since before historic times  Binjhwars  Baigas and Kamars have all been described by Russell as “ Dravidian tribes ”  It cannot be said what was the original form of their language but the claim that they are true aboriginals of the province appears to be just as  strong as that for the Korkus who according to Russell  being an offshoot of the great Kol or Munda tribe  came much further west than their kinsmen and settled in the Mahadeo hills  According to their own traditions  however they claim to be born of the soil and to have been especially created by Mahadeo as a population for his hills at the request of  Rawan  the demon  King of Ceylon  In Bihar and Orissa even the Austroasiatic languages  which have almost disappeared further west  are flourishing  and the Census Superintendent there reports that “ Since 1921 there has been an increase of about 577 000 or 17 7 per cent   in the number of  persons speaking          tribal languages   They have in fact more than kept pace with the general  increase in population  with the result that the proportion of the total population accounted for  by them has risen from 859 to 907 per 10 000  Two principal reasons may be advanced to explain this The first is that the aboriginal peoples themselves have multiplied more quickly than most other communities partly because their natural rate of growth is superior  and partly because many emigrants have returned during the last decade from the industrial centres of Bengal and the tea gardens of Assam  The second reason is that the procedure ” adopted at the present census of recording “ mother tongue ” and “ subsidiary language “ ”  ordinarily single language spoken has undoubtedly separately  instead of the led to a more     complete return of tribal languages as the mother tongue of persons who are bi lingual  To this latter cause must clearly be attributed the fact that in the district of Champaran 5 511 persons are shown as speaking Oraon at the present census  out of whom  5 508 speak Hindustani as a subsidiary language  In 1921  although there were nearly 10 000 Oraons Similarly  in that district  not a single one was returned as speaking his tribal tongue  in Balasore the number of Santali speakers has gone up abruptly from 9 655 to 15 120  and more than 10 000 of the latter are now shown as speaking a second language  Oriya  very few of the tribal languages are falling into disuse  The only ones in which the proportion of speakers is appreciably lower than it was ten years ago are Bhumij  Juang  Kharia  Mahili and Turi  In the case of Mahili the decrease probably has not much significance  for this dialect  like Karmali  is little more than a variant of Santali  and it is probable that Santali was entered fairly often as the mother tongue o persons speaking Mahili  The decline in Bhumij is most noticeable in the districts of Manbhum and Singhbhum  where the “ Hinduization ” of this tribe is proceeding apace in Mayurbhanj state  although Hinduism is now  returned as the religion of the great majority  the tribal feeling persists  with the result that the tribal language too is still vigorous in that area  Speakers of Juang have increased in To all intents and purposes this language number since 1921 from 10 531 to 14 583 Nor is the loss sustained by the Kharia language material  is as full of vitality as ever it was  though the proportion of speakers has fallen off slightly both in Ranchi and in the Orissa states  the two localities where this particular tribe is numerous  Turi  however  is definitely on he wane  In 1911 it was spoken by 2 701 persons  in 1921 by 1 808  and now it is spoken by only But in these days there is little to distinguish Turis from an ordinary low 1 215 Hindu caste  and the loss of their old tribal language is not a matter for surprise     The particularly marked increase in the proportion of persons speaking Kora is due Still more abrupt is the increase from 383 to primarily to vagaries of classification 6 270 in the number of persons speakuig Gondi  This represents a swing back to  and beyond  the position in 1911  when there were 1 212 speakers of this language  The fact is that in this province nearly every Gond has acquired the knowledge of a secondary language  and at the last census the tendency to return this secondary language in preference to the tribal dialect was apparently carried to a much further length with the Gonds than with most of the other aboriginal races   Taking together  the proportion of their members  speaking tribal  18 tribes  languages is 820 per mille  as compared with 802 per mille in 1921  In  areas where primitive races are most numerous a pleader  a zaniindar or a village mahajan may find it absolutely necessary as a matter of business to acquaint himself with their maime   of  Thus  in the Sadr sub division of Singhbhum the supremacy of Ho as the lingua franca In Ranchi a considerable number of the Aryan inhabitants speak Mundari and  to a less extent  Oraon  Curiously enough  Santali in the Santal Parganas seems speech   of the countryside is unchallenged   M220C     2a2  \f      CHAPTER X   354   LANGUAGE   to be treated much more cavalierly  and as a subsidiary language it is spoken just as widely in Manbhum  This can hardly be in accordance with the actual facts  and it is probable that  both in the Santal Parganas and in other parts of the plateau  the returns fail to do justice to the extent to which the use of tribal languages is current among non aborigmals  Some foolish notion of prestige may have restrained people from admitting that they were in the habit of  speaking these dialects ^ Xo  per  No   Tribal language   of  speakers   mille using some  The marginal statement shows for each tribal lanaguage the proportion of

tribes  One would 122 Malto 67 451 naturally expect bi hngualism to be a good deal more common among males than among females  but the returns do not bear out this expectation  So far as the aboriginal races are concerned  the ratio is 82 males to 79 females  It is not improbable that the returns are inaccurate in this respect  and that women were sometimes shown as speaking a second language simply because their husbands did so ”    In Bengal the Austroasiatic languages are out of their environment and find survival more difficult  while of Dra vidian languages Kurukh indeed has increased On the other hand the Tibeto Burmese languages a little hut Malto has decreased  seem hardy enough on the whole  though some have declined  Of these languages the Census Superintendent of Bengal writes    “ The total number speaking languages of the Bara group is 246 thousand compared with  Tipura spoken by nearly 192 000 persons makes the and those speaking it have increased from 158 734 in Those speaking Garo  Koch and Kachari have all decHned in numbers   1921 Kabha was not returned as a language in spite of there being over 3 000 members The total numbers S23eaking of the tribe

necessity for acquiring subsidiary languages  Throughout the whole of Bengal in ever   100 persons speaking these languages there are 33 who are bilingual to every 67 who are not Those speaking Kherwari adopt by preference Bengali as their subsidiary tongue W hereas those speaking Kharia more generally use Hindustani ”  226 thousand in 1921  largest contribution towards this group     m  Similarly in Assam the Census Superintendent is emphatic as to the vitality of tribal languages     “ We can  say definitely that the indigenous hill languages are as vigorous as As regards the tribal languages spoken in the plains Kachari  including Dimasa  and Eabha  both of which showed a decrease in 1921  have a considerable increase in the number of their speakere at this census To show the vio our of Kachari I need only mention that out of the 57 000 persons in Darrang who have returned their caste as Kachari 51  000 speak the Kachari language and in Kamrup out of 107 000 Kacharis 93 000 still claim Kachari as their mother tongue  The question of Eabha is difficult because ever and show no signs of erosion   \f   355  SURVIVAL OF TRIBAL LANGUAGES   owing to conversion to Hinduism the actual number of people who returned their tribe or caste as Eabha has been steadily decreasing since 1911  In that year there were 79 U00 Rabhas in 1921 only 70 000 and at this census 69 000  yet the number of speakers of Rabha is practically the same now  27 000  as in 1911  28 000   and considerably more than in 1921  22 000      the speakers of this language have declined at every census As for Lalung since 1901 but that I doubt whether the census figures represent the real number of speakers  On the whole I think we are justified in concluding that the tribal languages in the plains     are holding their own in a wonderful manner  Even the small Deori community about 4 000 strong appear to be in no danger of forgetting Chutiya  their mother tongue  Mr  McSwiney remarked in 1911 that the Chutiya language was practically defunct though it continued to     retain a small spark of life   That spark is still burning and shows no sign of being extinguished      It will be of intense interest to observe whether the Assamese language itself against the inroads of which the tribal languages of the plains have  for hundreds of years  put up such a stout fight will  in its turn  be able in the future  to defend itself against a new and a very powerful invader in the shape of Bengali which  with the coming of the Eastern Bengal settlers  has estabhshed itself firmly in all the districts of lower and central Assam ”     Of  bilingualism in Assam the Census Superintendent concludes that “  The statistics of bi hngualism are smaller than might have been expected and the only people in Assam who are bilingual to any extent are the speakers of Tibeto Burmese except in Goalpara  languages in Goalpara  Kamrup  Darrang  Sibsagar and Nowgong and  where two thirds of the Tibeto Burmese speakers have Assamese and one  third Bengali as their subsidiary language  the only subsidiary language which they can speak fluently is Assamese ”  This  of course  excludes the consideration of Tibeto Burmese languages inter se  as the Census Superintendent  in view of their unconscionable number and variety   has necessarily treated them as a whole for statistical purposes  These languages are however so variable and multiform that each differs totally from its neighbour as a spoken vernacular  and there are cases in the Naga Hills where the mothertongues of opposite sides of the village street are so different that  although one is always knomi to both sides  the one in lesser use may be incomprehensible across the road  and it is common to hear tw^o people colloguing while answering each The Census in his own tongue the questions of his vis a vis asked in the other’s  certain error of stating the very that thus fallen into has Assam for erintendent Suj few know true that Assamese  It is good linguists  not are tribes hill the Assam Little opportunity have they to learn  and less to learn Bengali or Hindustani  but there  are small villages where the children grow up fluent in five languages each of which would puzzle a Dutchman to learn a little of in two years  and in the State of Manipur the majority of male tribesmen are bilingual in their own tongues  and Manipuri  while a combined knowledge of some Kuki language  some Naga language and the Manipuri language must be extremely frequent  The incredible rapidity with which a Naga or Kuki interpreter acquires an additional language with the most limited opportunity for doing so has to be experienced to  be appreciated  and there are some villages which in addition to real languages compose jargons and counter jargons of their own in order to be able to chatter incomprehensibly in the presence of  others   particularly  when  discussing  a  proposition of purchase  sale or barter   152 The fact that no linguistic map w^as prepared for the United Provinces as mentioned above is involved in a difficulty not of subsidiary languages but of mother tongues  a difficulty which was very far from being confined to the United Provinces  This difficulty was that  familiar from former census reports  of distinguishing in the census record between the various dialects of Hindustani Generally speaking classified by Sir George Grierson as different languages  one dialect fades into another by indistinct and gradual changes so that it is very here the Eastern group difficult to draw a hard and fast fine and say for instance ’  ends and the IMediate begins here ends Mediate Hindi and beyond is  Wbstern It was anticipated that this difficulty would be found to operate in the case of all the languages of the Indo Aryan branch of the Indo European family  but as a matter of fact this did not prove to be the case wdth all of them  Eajasthani and Bhili  for instance  gave little difficulty  but the distinction between Eastern and Western Hindi in the Central Provinces and Central India  and between Lahnda and Panjabi in the Punjab was more than the census enumerators could grasp  As for the enumerated  each of course very properly considers his Hindi to be the true Hindi and is not prepared to qualify it by an adjective of locality implying    ‘     5122 CC  Difficulties  in classifying Indo   Aryan Languages   \f      CHAPTER X   356   I^’^GUAGE   that it is merely a dialect  Too much precision must not therefore be expected of figures representing the use of Eastern and Western Hindi and of Lahnda and Panjabi  as it was necessary in the course of compilation to assign large numbers of speakers of Hindi  and similarly of Panjabi  more or less arbitrarily to one or the other group according to locality  since the returns were inevitably unqualified  In the United Provinces no attempt was made to distinguish Eastern from Western Hindi and for the purpose of the linguistic maps the line has been taken arbitrarily as the boundary  more or less  of Agra and Oudh provinces  which is probably as nearly correct as any other convenient boundary that could be chosen  Seript  153 The United Provinces again proved a stumbling block to a return of script  Some idea of the respective numbers who use each of the various vernacular scripts That such a return is possible has been shown is unquestionably a desideratum  by the Punjab  ill which a return was made of the script of literacy and numbers are available of those who use the Urdu  Nagari  and Gurmukhi scripts respectively similarly by the Central Provinces and Berar  where figures are now available for hteracy in Hindi   or Marathi  and Urdu respectively bjAlie Central India Agency by Hyderabad  and for which the returns cover the same three scripts and Gujarati an ancient controversy Provinces United Kashmir But in the State  by Jammu and about the use of the terms Hindi and Urdu for the spoken language apparently gave rise to the fear that a similar controversy would arise as a result of asking for the script of literacy  As there can be no argument as to whether a given script is Urdu or Hindi it is difficult to comprehend the relevancy of this fear and it might have been surmised that the Local Government would have found the return of script useful  In the case of the spoken language admittedly the use of the terms Urdu and Hindi do give rise to embittered controversy between two schools which are generally speaking conterminous with Hinduism and Islam in rehgion  In point of practice it is impossible to derfine any boundary between Urdu and Hindi as spoken           since the difference consists merely in a preference for a Persian or for a Sanskrit  vocabulary  and as an ilhterate man uses only the language of common speech it is generally the bias of the enumerator which would determine the category of his As far as spoken language goes therefore it was decided  as in 1921   to use return  the term Hindustani only in the return for the United Provinces  and with the omission of the script of literacy the use of the term Urdu disappeared  This disappearance caused some searching of heart among Muslims who did not realise that the reason for omitPersons literate in ting the term Urdu was that no general record of the Gurmukhi  Hindi  Marathi  Urdu  Roman  Prov  or State  script was being made at 18 422 1 083 3 844 7 111 3 490 Baluchistan the census  For H  E  H  44 247 380 950  C  P  and Berar the Xizam’s

characters  abandonment of any of the numerous scripts in use in India  the militate against sooner or later some common script will have to be probable that but it seems now Roman script adopted by Turkey would probably be the most the adopted  and  common tongue   satisfactory compromise in spite of its alien origin and its paucity of symbols  Hindustani in the Roman script is already in use in the Army and proves eminently satisfactory  and owing to the discharge of soldiers accustomed to use it  it must be spreading slowly in all areas in which the Indian Army recruits  The inclusion  in the census schedule of a return of script would have provided figures for its diffusion and a basis for subsequent comparisons  but unfortunately the already over crowded schedule could not be made to carry more  and the only returns of it  available are those for the Punjab  where 6 587 persons were recorded as hterate in that script  for Baluchistan with 3 844  and Delhi with 175  Meanwhile the paradox continues of the most anti British elements in India having to debate their politics  \f   367  AUSTROASIATIC   in English  while in an article advocating the substitution of Hindi for English as a common language for India an Indian newspaper  itself published in English   adopted as a slogan the words “ Linguistic Inqilab Zindabad ”  translatable perhaps “ Up the Zabdni Rebels    and to complete the picture the existing superfluity of vernacular scripts has been inflicted with an addition during the decade under review  in Burma a Chin reformer named Pao Chin Hao  vide infra

with a transliteration in the chapter on Language in the Burma Census Report and the first two pages of the spelling book appear below with a transliteration     m  Section  ii    Linguistic Pre history  154 In 1867 it was pointed out by Mr  E  Thomas in a letter to the Asiatic    Society of Bengal that the Aryan invaders of southern Eurojxe and south west Asia had invented no alphabet of their own in the course of their wanderings  but were in every case indebted to the country in which they settled for the provision of His inference was that in characters for the reduction of their speech to writing  the case of India the Sanskrit alphabet had its ultimate source in some method of writing known to the pre Aryan inhabitants  This suggestion was immediately attacked and scouted as incompatible with the then unquestioned view that the Indo Europeans found India a completely uneivilized country uxhabited by barbarous tribes  and while a probably Senutic origin for the earliest form of the Devanagari script was generally admitted  it was regarded as a post Aryan importation  It has taken sixtyfive years to find evidence that the Brahmi alphabet is after all derived from the symbols used on their seals by the pre Aryans of the Indus Valley   and that the theory that the symbols of the Brahmi script were imported from Phoenicia during the first milienium B  C   or locally invented after the Indo   The Brahmi alphabet  European invasion  is not only now urmecessary but improbable  For although Professor Konow and some others are not yet entirely satisfied  Professor Langdon seems to have eflectively demonstrated the coimection between the Brahmi script and the signs of the Mohenjodaro seals  while Hr  Pran Nath seems to have arrived independently at the same conclusion  and Mr  Thomas seems to be justified at last in the analogy he drew between the sources of the Indo European alphabets in Greece and in India respectively  What Langdon says is that if his two main hy xotheses are true  i e   the identity of the Indus with the Sumerian signs and the derivation of the Brahmi characters from the Indus signs then it must follow that the Aryan In Sanskritists gave values derived fiom their own language to these characters  meanings  translated them into Sanskrit  ideographic knew the other words they and derived the syllabic values from the Sanskrit words ”  This alone is enough to explode the theory  if any retain it  that the existing civilization of India postdates the Indo European invasion  for had the people of the Indus valley been exterminated or expelled their symbols could not have furnished the basis for the hterature of their conquerors  and though it is possible that the Indus valley itself had  as Sir Jo hn Marshall holds  been vacated before the Rigvedic Aryans came in  it is quite obvious that there must have been a fusion of culture either there or elsewhere  and it was probably  in fact it must have been  in the Ganges basin  ‘  155 This raises the question  which cannot be answered at any rate until the Mohenjodaro script is completely deciphered  as to what language was spoken in Upper India before the Indo Europeans  The most natural hjqxothesis would be that the language was a Dra%ddian one  since that is the most widely spread family in    page 45  that “ it was from the and hence Sanskrit characters are to Nagas that the Arj as first learnt the art of writing this day known as Deva Nagari ”  but he quotes no authority or reference for what is perhaps   Mr  Kanakasabhai states  r«»u7s

general tendency among languages appears to be  for the easier and the socially more useful to supplant the more difficult or less useful  though the latter south   may at the same time by a similar process be replacing other less efficient or less estimated tongues  Thus the Goidelic language  probably at one time the prevailing language of ’   ales  was pushed to the western coast by the later Brythonic  and the latter has followed it in turn and is now in some parts of Wales the slowly disappearing tongue of descendants of those whose natural speech was at one time Goidelic  which only survives in certain forms of enumeration  place names and a  few words of Irish or the so called fairy speech   and in some cases probably an even earlier and pre Goidel language  Similarly it seems probable that many tribes in India who now speak a Dra vidian language formerly spoke a Mimda one  xkt any rate the fact that the Oraon  for instance  speaks a Dravidian language is no evidence at all that he is not racially nearly allied to the Munda with whom his culture would appear to connect him  though culture again like language  is not a criterion Similarly the Malers or Sauria Paharias of the Rajmahal hills still speak a of race   Draffidian language  though their relatives the Mai Paharias have adopted an Indo European one  Both tribes have apparently been pushed back from their more fertile lands by Santals who have come up from the isolation of the Chota Kagjiur Plateau with what is probably a still more ancient language than Dra   idian  and one which is actually likely to have been the original language of both Mai and Sauria Paharias  The position in India has been much complicated by its history  for it seems that probably Munda languages once occupied the greater part of Upper India  but were pushed back to the hills and forests by the early civilization of the Indus and Ganges valleys speaking probably Dravidian languages  In the alternative the language of the earliest civilization may itself have been a Mimda language and been superseded by the Dravidian of later arrivals  The Austroasiatic languages are the most widely distributed in the world as far as geographical distances go  being found from the Punjab in the Nort h to New Zealand Von in the south and from Madagascar in the west to Easter Island in the east  Baer’s zoological law that the most widely distributed in space are also the most widely distributed in time can probably be applied with equal force to all languages which have preceded modern methods of rapid distribution  and if so indicates unquestionably that the Austroasiatic is an older group of tongues than the Dravidian  and the obvious inference is that they preceded Dravidian in India  The Dravidian speakers however were thiust out of their domain by Indo European languages before they liad more than  partially penetrated the hill fastnesses  and while some of the Munda speakers have retained their languages to this day others were apparently Indo Europeanised in tongue without passing through a genuinely Dravidian stage  though haffing assimilated a number of borrowed words  while others  whose Munda language seems to have survived both the Dravidian and Indo European occupations of the Ganges valley  have been Dravidianised after the latter event by a northerly movement of tribes from the Dravidianised south  There is however  a serious void in our knowledge in that no intensive work appears to have been done on the tribal dialects of southern India  so that it is impossible to say whether the Munda languages ever penetrated to the The Linguistic Survey unfortunately did not extreme south of India or not  include southern India in its scope  and there is therefore a crying need for an intensive study of the dialects spoken by such tribes as the Kadar  Kurumans  Paliyans  Paniyans and Thanda Pulayans with the object of discovering whether or no any Munda sur^dvals are to be found  If Munda languages extended to southern India  they must inevitably have left some traces in the speech of the If they did not we need to know what was the pre Dra vidian inhabitants  there  Some tribes or castes  e g   the Kakkalans of pre Dravidian language have reported to languages peculiar to themselves  Travancore  are  Another obscure and debatable point in regard to the distribution of the Munda languages is the direction from which they reached India  Their connection with   Dr  Guha regards Oraon skulls as showing some physical difierenees from those of Mundas  but admits  I think  a very close relationship  At any rate the co efficients of racial likeness given bv him for Oraon and Munda show a difference of only 1 79   \fAUSTROASIATIC   359  the rest of the Austroasiatic family has suggested difEusion from the east westwards  in which case they must have penetrated north west up the Ganges Valley and along the foot of the Himalayas and up into the hills by such routes as the Kangra Valley  suTvi sdng now only in the inner ranges between Ladakh and Sikkim  South westwards on the other hand they survive in the west of the Central Provinces and must have extended to the Vindhyas and possibly to the west coast  as Bhili at any rate contains some Munda remnants and the very name of the Kolis suggests Munda affinities  Southwards the Sawaras of the Vizagapatam and Ganjam hills and the Gadabas of the adjoining tracts in the Central Provinces have definitely Munda tongues  though the western branches of this tribe  which extends at least to the borders of Rajputana  have lost their distinctive speech  and several of the Gond groups have culture elements which suggest Austroasiatic affinities  the Maria Gonds  for instance  the Koyas  the Bhatras and the Parjas of Bastar and Jeypore  where the so called Bonda Parjas call themselves Bonds simply  as if Munda mth a cold in the head   shave the heads of their women like Konyak Nagas of the Chagyik group and dress them in masses of bead ornaments and narrow petticoats open on one hip exactly like some of the Konyak Kaga tribes among whom Mon Khmer linguistic survivals can be traced  It maybe noted in passing that this narrow petticoat is very suggestive of the garment worn by the clay figurines of the  Mother Goddess found in quantities in Harappa and Mohenjodaro as also in The Ods or Vaddars  who seem to have Munda affinities  go further south on their wanderings  but their homeland is Clrissa  and it seems possible that the Badagas of the Kilgiiis ma y have cultural affinities with some Munda tribes  Kevertheless the roost southerly point to which the Munda languages have yet been traced is north of the Godavari river  The southerly distribution of the Munda languages however does not necessarily affect the questioii of the direction from wnich they reached India  and it seems just as likely that they came from the north west and spread down the Ganges Valley to the east as that they came up the valley in the opposite direction  Moreover  if Munda’s affinity with the languages of south east Asia and the Pacific be unquestioned it is also possible that it had affinities with the agglutinative Sumerian language westwards of it  and it would      Crete   possibly be the safest hypothesis that various branches of the Austroa siatic languages originally radiated in a more or less southerly direction from a common centre in central or south east Asia  even though it seems certain that the Indus Valley civilization affords a link between Upper India and Sumer    An important position in the distribution of the Austroasiatic laiiguagos in Ifingiiistic India is held by the Kicobar Islands  Xicobarese according to the between Munda and Mon Khmer  Survey  occupies a position intermediate Meillet and Cohen  Les Lmujues dti Movde  classify Xicobarese with the MonKhmer family  but remark that it fonns an excejfiion to the rest of that group  in retaining the use of suffixes to form derivatives  a character which it has in common they continue  “ si la nikobarais a with Munda  “ 11 est difficile de decider innove sous des influences occidentales ou s il a conserve un trait ancien  aboli The very isolation of the depuis longtemps dans les langues parlees a Test ”  Xicobars  and their complete absence of contact for many hundreds of years with any language of the Munda group is in itself a solution to the doubt expressed  and the inference is that the Munda languages generally retain a more ancient characteristic lost by the Mon Khmer branch  a consideration which inclines one to the view that their distribution has at any rate not been from east to west  On the other hand some account must be taken of the theory  favoured apparently by Prof  Sylvain Levi and by Prof  Craighill Handy  for instance  of Oceanic intrusions into India  In a paper on PoljTiesian origins  Bernice P  Bishop Museum  Occnl  Papers  IX

common prevalence of a roughly shouldered type probably almost equally effective for practical purposes but obviously involving far less labour in the making  The true Irrawadi type of adze is not only very exactly squared at the shoulders but is worked flat and The roughly shouldered adze common in the Naga Hills polished throughout  and the Santal Parganas is polished only on the plano convex cutting edge  the tang end being left rough  and a shoulder roughly worked sometimes on one side of the adze only  In the N  Cachar Hills  in an area occupied by a number of prehistoric groups of enormous monolithic urns of phalHc shape  which contained the ashes of the dead and are probably forerunners of the Khasi stone cists and clan burials  a number of stone axes andYadzes have been found

much more perfect than the western  This suggests the possibihty that the shouldered stone adze may be a derivation from the metal type and not its original  which would involve a distribution eastwards from the centre in which the copper originals are found and which corresponds closely with that of the non  Ary an kingdoms of the Saudyumnas  plausibly identified with the Munda and Mon Khmer by Pargiter  and occcupying a country still occupied by Sawara and Munda tribes  This h ^othesis would also account for the apparently quite unnecessary labour expended bn the fabrication of the square shouldered Irrawadi celt w hich is difficult to understand if it were not the natural result of an attempt to copy a metal original as exactly as the available material permitted  If this hypothesis be rejected we must regard the shouldered copper celt as subsequent to the shouldered stone adze  Either or both might have given rise to the existing iron hoe  since there seems to have been no copper age in Assam or Burma  But if the copper celt be later it supports the hypothesis that the shouldered adze is intrusive from Indonesia  whereas if the copper form be the original type the stone form must have reached Oceania from the west  and not India or Indonesia from the south east  In the latter case it has to be considered whether the roughly shouldered adzes of the Naga Hills and Santal Parganas are degenerate forms of the flat square shouldered and highly polished Irrawadi adze or their undeveloped prototype  and the development of so unnecessarily laborious a type as the square shouldered adze from an equally efficient if less polished implement seems unlikely  If on the other hand the prototype be Oceanian it cannot be Indian and in that case we must regard the square shouldered adze as having degenerated in its original material in one place while leading perhaps simultaneously to improved copper and iron types in others  not perhaps an impossibility  It would appear however on the face of it that the shouldered adze is a type much more likely to originate in metal than in stone    Shouldered adzes have involved a digression from the matter of language  but it is difficult to consider the question of the Munda languages entirely apart  inches  SHOUI DEREC HOES FROM AL UBAIDfo ^e   HaU i WOo Cey    The following bibliography of shouldered

XXVII   this particular feature does not seem to appear in India west of Chota Nagpur  but the vestiges of Munda occupation are to be found as already indicated all over northern India  Prof  Przyluski in a series of articles in the Memoires and in the Bulletin of the Societe de Linguistique has pointed out a number of Austroasiatic loans in vocabularies of Indo European languages spoken in India  Indeed in a paper in the Royal Asiatic Society’s Journal in 1931 he derives the name of Varuna as well as the Hittite Aruna from a Sumerian root and an Austroasiatic  STONE implement   PREDYNA3TIC tttYPT  afte e Sit FtindLe fi Petfie^  god of the sea  Barn  and holds that there is no reason to suppose that Varuna was ever anything other than a sea god  This seems on the face of it an unnecessarily extreme position to adopt  as it would seem by no means unlikely that the Indo Europeans merely confused the god of the heavens with an indigenous god of similar name but different attributes  a sort of confusion that has frequently taken place for instance between pre Christian deities and Christian saints in Europe  e g   St  Anne   unless indeed Uranus himself is also to be identified as a Baru with changed functions  However that may be  in a paper in the Journal Asiatique in 1926  Un ancien peuple du Penjab les Udumbara  Przyluski has penetratingly discussed the significance to be attributed to the gourd origin myth so widespread in south east Asia and to the distribution of names associated with a pre Aryan word tumba in Sanskrit as a loan word to designate the colocynth Lagenia vulgaris  He demonstrates the distribution of this word in Indonesia and    its association with the similar fruit of the Ficus glomerata  called in Sanskrit udumbara  with certain names of musical instruments made of gourds  and so with one of the functions of the widespread caste of degraded musicians known as Dom Domna  Dombar  etc   who may be regarded as representing early inhabitants of northern India  If we accept  as we must  the force of his argument we may see a survival of the Munda speaking Austroasiatic population of northern India not only in the Dorns  and no doubt in the very similar Korava group  but in the Kurumbas of southern India  to whose former predominance the tract in Halabar still knowm as Kurumbranad yet testifies and who are still associated like the ancient Kodumbara with the keeping of sheep and the production of woollen cloth  and with the Gadaba  no Telugu ear would tolerate “ Gadamlra ”  and the m would drop out as easily as it has from Kuruba   who still speak a Munda language and seem to be associated with the kindred Bhatra tribe    That this was the original form  is  perhaps confirmed hy the existence  district of the variants Gutob and Gutumuo for Gadaba   in  Vizagapatam  \fAUSTEOASIATIC  in the  Orissa hinterland as  Przylnski’s  Udumbara with  365 his  Bhadra   Bv an  ingenious equation of these tribes with the Padaei of Herodotus  Przyluski associates these Munda speakers with the Melanesians through the practice of eating their aged relatives like the Bataks of Sumatra  and this practice has been attributed to the Birhors of Chota Nagpur who speak a Mundari tongue  cf  infra  It remains to be pointed out that the Kuruba as also the Kuruman page 404   are still associated with megalithic and dolmenic burials like so many of the tribes who have retained their Austroasiatic speech  while the stories of aged relativeeating have a distribution corresponding roughly with that of Munda languages  to day  attributing the practice to hill tribes of Chhattisgarh and the Amarkantak tableland  to the Birhors of Chota Nagpur  to hill tribes in Assam  to some  Kachins in north west of Burma and to the Wa in the east of it    The fruit is they say according to the Shans  “ let us eat it    as they shake down their aged parents from the branche s they have made them ascend   ripe  156   One conclusion of Przyluski’s however  it does not seem  po ssible to the Austroasiatic speakers in nortliern India generally as having pushed out the Dravidian speakers from the whole of the fertile valleys of northern India leaving a mere island of Dravidian speakers in Baluchistan  It seems to us far more probable  in view of what has alreadv been stated as to the wider distribution and greater antiquity of Austroasiatic languages  and maps of the distribution of Dravidian and Munda languages suppoi t  accept   He seems  to regard  Dravldian   \fCHAPTER X   366   LANGUAGE   that the Munda preceded the Dravidian in the Peninsula generally  and was pushed to the south east by the Dravidian which was in its turn superseded by the Indo European tongues  Przyluski has laid some emphasis on He^pdotus account of the races of India  and identifies the warlike race of the tliis view   ’  north with the Indo Europeans  the Ethiopianhke race of the far south with the Dravidians  and the intermediate races  of which Herodotus describes two  as Austroasiatic  Herodotus says  however  that there are many nations of Indians speaking different languages  and that the most easterly part is desert  Apparently Herodotus  knowledge did not extend eastwards beyond the Thar desert and must have been confined southwards to the west coast perhaps no further than Bombay  It is also not clear in what sense the term “ Dravidian ” is used by Przyluski as he appears to refer to the Dravidian languages but to the preDravidian physical type  Dravidian languages have left much clearer survivals in north west India than the Munda ones  for though the latter have  as effectively demonstrated by Przyluski  left strong traces in vocabulary  the former have affected the actual speech of the Indo Europeans  providing it with cerebrals to the extent of requiring distinctive letters of the alphabet  while Dravidian loan words have been indicated in much greater number than have Munda ones so far  and the story of the Deluge  which is undoubtedly of Mesopotamian origin and absent from the Eigveda  retains  as pointed out by Caldwell  words of Dravidian origin for two of its most important features water  nira  and fish  mitia   while  as pointed out by Professor N  K  Dutt  SatyavTata Manu  the Indian counterpart of Xoah  is described in the Puranas as “ the lord of Dravida ”  Professor Eapson  Cambridge History of India    4i  regards Dravidian languages as having been actual    flourishing in the western regions of Northern India at the period when languages of the Indo European type were introduced ” It seems therefore necessary to regard the Dravidian speakers as having been the latest pre IndoEuropean occupants of Upper India  as having reached India from the north west where their language remains among the Brahui  who actually regard the Mohenjodaro ruins as the work of their ancestors   and as having brought with them the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia  Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean  The Deluge legend might of course have been acquired locally in India from Austroasiatic inhabitants of Sumerian affinities  but this does not alter the fact that the Indo Europeans seem to have accpiired it in a Dravidian dress  Schoener  Alt dravuUsches   Eine Namenknndliche Untersuchung  has traced Dravidian placenames in Mesopotamia and Iran  and although his theories do not seem to have been gcncrall   found acceptable  further evidence that this Dravidian tongue reached India from the west is indicated by the recent investigations  1930  of G  AY  Bre wn who has shown  Jour  American Oriental Society  50  273  sqq   that the Kharian language spoken in Mitanni at the bend of the Euphrates both before and after its conquest by the Indo European invaders has striking similarities to the Dravidian languages of India today  as it also has on the other hand with some surviving languages of the Caucasus  Kharian  or Hurrian  is also stated to have been the tr ue non Indo European Hittite of Asia Minor ” and to be nearly related to the Haluian of early Armenia  T his if it prove to be definitely substantiated  is not at all surprising in view of the wide distribution of both Mediterranean and Armenoid physical characteristics in the population of India  and of the many elemeirts in the Hindu religion w hich connect it with Mesopotamia and with the Nt ar East  A Dravidian tongue in ancient Mesopotamia in fact precisely what might have been expected to be discovered now that is we know for certain from the Indus Valley finds what has long been suspected  that India was not an isolated cvelter of australoid tribes till the Indo Europeans entered it in the 2nd milieniuni B  C   but had a civihsation  comparable to and in communication with the ancient kingdoms of Mesopotamia  far older and in most ways more highly developed than that of the Indo European invaders who estabhshed themselves in India precisely as they did in Babylon  as barbarian        rulers of more cultured peoples  Iiido Etiropean   157   With the advent in India of the Indo European we come at any rate within the range of historical tradition and the distribution and   Personal information from Mr  E  J  H  Mackay wliile he was engaged in excavating that site  Colonel Sewell  however  regards the tradition as spurious and suggested by the excavators themselves  J  H  H      \fINDO EUROPEAK  inter relation of the  367  Indo European languages has been so exhaustively treated  by Sir George Grierson that the most that would be justified here is to sum up very briefly his conclusions  He tells us that Sansliit is the purified literary language arising from the dialects of the Rigveda that the languages of the “ Outer Branches ”  that is Lahnda or Western Panjabi  Sindhi  Marathi  Oriya  Bihari  Bengali and Assamese  are derived from a different dialect of the original IndoEuropean tongue than are the languages of the “ Inner Branch ”  Western Hindi  Panjabi  Gujarati  Bhili  Khandeshi  Rajasthani and the Pahari dialects  Eastern Hindi is intermediate between the two  while of the Inner Branch languages Gujarati at any rate retains traces of the Outer language which it has superseded  From the same colloquial source as Sanskrit arose the Midland language of the Inner Branch always regarded as not only the true t q e of the Indo Aryan tongue    but as the tongue of the true and pure Indo Aryan people  This difference between the Irmer and Outer languages is regarded as a confirmation of Hoernle’s theory of the first and second wave of Indo European immigration  the second wave being supposed to have entered India through Chitral to the east of the first already established in the Punjab  A further confirrnation of this view is said to have been found in the racial differences between the inhabitants of the Punjab and those of the United Provinces   No definite proof of the truth of this theory has  however  been found  and does not seem essential to an interpretation of the facts as accepted  though M22CC b2 it  \f368  CHAPTER X    SLANGUAGE   course in conflict with them  It appears on the face of it unlikely on account of the difliculty of the route through the Himalayas indicated by the theory  Rai Bahadur Ramaprasad Chanda in his hido Aryan Races has convincingly argued the existence of two groups of Brahmans  one fair which he regards as having come from the north west  and the other swarthy from southwest Asia which he considers came across the Arabian Sea  He infers from this and from other evidence an invasion of Indo European speakers from the east of Babylonia  but there appears to be no evidence whatever that the earlier nordic invaders of Mesopotamia  who seem to have established themselves as rulers of the Hittites  succeeded in effectively imposing their language on their subjects  though it is believed that the Kanesian dialect  in which certain Indo European features occur  was the official tongue of the Hittite Empire  Similarly the above mentioned Kharri appear to have been a non nordic race with nordic chieftains  and their location is in the north west of Mesopotamia  If therefore Chanda’s theory is to be accepted it will be simpler and safer to regard these Mesopotamian invaders as Dravidian speakers  In any case their culture and religion must have been that of the Mesopotamian basin  and the movement of peoples and culture from Mesopotamia to northern India must be put at such an early date that it is hardly possible to regard the movement as having had any impulse from the proto nordic steppe folk  who only appear to have begun to invade Mesopotamia towards the end of the 3rd millenium B  C  Modified to this extent there is much to support Chanda’s theory  which will not then differ in effect from that already advanced of a previous invasion of Dravidian speakers  There is moreover another interpretation possible of the distribution of the Inner and the Outer Bands of Indo Aryan languages  The Outer Band is that of languages which have retained certain features characteristic of the Pisacha or Dardic group  a group of languages still spoken in the Pamirs and in the north western hills of India  The Inner Band has none of these features  It may be added that it is the Inner Band which has developed a script  on which the Outer is dependent  It will be pointed out in a subsequent chapter that there is very good reason for supposing that between the end of the Mohenjodaro civilisation in the Indus valley and the entry of the Rigvedic Aryans the Indus valley was subjected to an invasion of Alpines from the Pamirs  It is not improbable that these Alpines had acquired an Indo European language  and they may even have had proto nordic leaders  The oldest language in the Pamirs  and it is one which  is stated by Grierson to exist as a substratum to all the Dardic tongues  is the so far unclassed language the present form of which is known as Burushaski  Probably this was the language of the Alpine inhabitants before they came into contact with the common ancestors of the Avesta Iranians and the Rigvedic Aryans  But these had left their northern steppes and were wandering in the neighbourhood of the Iranian plateau long before they descended on the plains of the Punjab  and may have been responsible not only for the disturbance of the Alpines  but for their adoption of a variety of their language it is not of  \fINDO EXmOPEAN   369  It is also possible that they had infected the Alpine culture and rehgion with some affinity to their own by supplying it with rulers and war lords as they did to the  Alpine peasants in Central Europe  The Pisacha language introduced in northern India would naturally be pushed out by the later Rigvedic Aryans  though their continued occupation of the whole of the west bank of the Indus and both banks of its upper waters would be quite enough to ac count for the assimilation to the Outer Band language of the narrow strip of land between Peshawar and Sialkot  which  if this theory be correct  should belong to the Inner group  much as the extension of the Inner Band to the Gujarat coast has interrupted the former continuity of the Outer Band from Baluchistan to Kanara  if indeed Gujarati should not still he classified with the Outer Band  which is at least a debatable proposition  Indeed some such strip of country lost to the Inner Branch must somewhere remain whatever be the hypothesis adopted  and Grierson  Linguistic Survey  I i  108  gives other reasons for a southward movement of Eranians or Pamiris subsequent to the Indo Aryan invasion  In any case Hoernle’s theory of the  second invasion from the north seems than Professor Rapson’s view of the occupation of the Punjab as occurring in the course of migration while that of the Ganges valley belongs to a later epoch of colonization  It must be recognised that if Sanskrit owes its script to the previous civilization of northern India there must have been amalgamation and an interchange of cultural ideas between the colonists and the pre existing population  whether or not they already worshipped Vedic deities  The culture of Mesopotamia  when invaded by the Kassites and other northern warrior tribes  was vastly

darkhaired Ionian  that literature and philosophy flourished  not at Dorian Sparta  where the population remained more martial perhaps  but less cultured  as the Punjab compared to the Madhyadesa  The

Extracts from correspondence between the Census Commissioner for India and Mr  J  J  Bennison  Census Saperinteiu ent of Bumia in regard to a new ivritten character in Burma and Assam    i   From Census Commissioner for India to Census Superintendent for Burma  dated THE 2I TH March 1932  “ I think I am right in saying that the character  that has been revealed to  Pao Chin Hao  involves an alphabet of an unconscionable length  since he has a different character  I think  for every possible monosyllable  At any rate  that is the line on which his revelation ran  according to the information I had from Manipur  One official sent me sheets of Pao Chin Plao’s characters and said they were too many to record completely ”    ii   From Census Superintendent for Burma  to Census Commissioner for India  dated THE 9th May 1932  “ I understand from the Rev  W  Sherratt   Agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society  in Burma  that the original alphabet as revealed to Pow Chin How did contain a  very large  number of characters  Mr  Sherratt visited the Chin Hills in March 1931 and pointed out to him that the large number of characters was a very great drawback  Pow Chin How and a few of his followers then got together and reduced the number considerably  Three or four of them then came down and saw Mr  Sherratt about May 1931 and eventually The Sermon on the Mount was printed  A copy is enclosed herewith  Mrs  Sherratt wrote out the words in Indian ink and this was photographed and zinc plates made  There are only 21 consonants in the ‘  ’  alphabet but in addition to the usual vowels there are a few final syllables similar to those in Burmese  There are also a few tones  Pow Chin How’s eldest son Shian Ko Chin  and another ‘  of his followers  Than Chin Kbam  came down in March this year to see Mr  Sherratt and I saw them once  Than Chin Kham is a vernacular school teacher in Tonzan village near Tiddim and he knows Burmese  I understand he has played a large part in producing the new alphabet  He is translating St  Matthew into the new characters  He uses the Burmese version of St  Matthew and also a Chin version  in the Roman character  which was done by hlr  Cope  the  American Baptist Missionary in the Chin Hills  He maintains that the Chin sounds can be properly represented in these new characters but not in the Roman characters He does not know any English but he has a fairly good knowledge of Burmese Mr  Cope apparently thinks there is no need for another character as the Roman character is already well known in the Chin Hills and the school text books a re all in the Roman character in addition to being an A  B  M   padre he F also an Honorary Inspector of Schools ”    Aioerican Baptist Mission   \f\foloJ AMMU

eli^ion  Section i   Religion and the Census  158  Although on the face of it religion would appear to be a concern purely for the individual  and in spite of the recent pronouncement of an eminent Frenchman to the effect that the deity is an academic subject  “ la question de Dieu tnanque d’actualite”   yet strongly held religious convictions ine dtably react on political situations and cannot be divorced from those aspects of social life of which the State and therefore the census must take cognizance  This is particularly the case in India  which is still the most religious country in the world  and must be regarded as the justification for the importance attached to religion in the census of India as compared  for example  with that of United States of America  where culture is comparatively independent of religion  In India the two are so inseparably bound up that religion  always a conservative force  appears as a positive obstacle to cultural unity   ‘ReUjion’   has been argued that the census statistics of religion tend to perpetuate the census cannot  however  hide its head in the sand like the proverbial ostrich  but must record as accurately as possible facts as they exist  and there is no question of the existence of communal difierences which are It is not in its devotional aspect that reflected at present in political constituencies  the census is concerned with rehgion  but in its social  and it cannot be denied but society in India is still largely organised on a basis of caste and religion  and social conduct is much influenced by practices which may not be in themselves The age of marriage  the religious but which are subject to religious sanctions  practice of remarriage  the observance of purdah  the occupations of women  the inheritance of property and the maintenance of widows  even diet  to name a few obvious cases  vary according to the caste and the rebgious community of the The time will no doubt come when occupation will serve the purpose at individual  present served by religion and caste in presenting demographic data  but that time is not yet  and at the present moment their barriers have not so far decayed that their social importance can be ignored for public purposes  though progress in this The social importance direction may well prove much faster than one anticipates  of religious differences is reflected in the controversial disputes about religious Hindu  Jain  Buddhist  terminology for census purposes  The census terms are This is the most Tribal and Others  Sikh  Zoroastrian  Jew  Muslim  Christian  since difficulty satisfactory but is admittedly not practical division available in that of the term Hindu particularly so many of these terms  arises in the case of Many Hindus for terms used  exclusive of some of the other which is not entirely Hindu inasmuch as their Buddhists are also Jains and Sikhs  claim that instance this claim the other hand is Hindu religion  On origin in the their faiths had it was therefore necessary of Sikhs and to great majority the repudiated by stoutly In the case oi Jains many  treat the terms Hindu and Sikh as mutually exclusive  orders were issued that any Hindu and themselves as all  regard means but by no Hindu could also do so and the was fact that he record the wished to who Jain tables would show in a footnote the number of Jains who consider themselves Hindus  In the United Provinces the Census Superintendent reports that the present tendency among Jains is towards se^egation from rather than amalgamation with Hindus and that intermarriage with Hindu families is becoming more impopular  though there is less objection to taking Hindu wives than to giving It was claimed by the Hindu Mahasabha that a few brides to Hindu males  Buddhists adopted the same position as Jains who regard themselves as Hindus  but from Buddhists as well as Jains protests were received against the possibility In order to get round the ambiguity it was of their being classified as Hindus  also ordered that Buddhists might likewise describe themselves as Hindu  and the totals of Buddhists who so regard themselves will be found in footnotes in Table XVI  In all 12 326 out of a total for India of 1 252 631 Jains  and 70 Buddhists out of 12 786 831 described themselves as being Hindus  and of these 526 Jains and 25 Buddhists actually appear as Hindus in the statistical tables  It  communal divisions     Some other schismatics have similarly an ambiguous position   In 1881 Hinduisna  from religions separate Since as shown were Satnami Kabirpanthi and this occasion and on with Hindus they incorporated have been that year they 159      379    Amblgnow  \fCHAPTER XI   380   ^RELIGION   have been similarly treated except in Bombay where a few Kabirpanthis and Dadupanthis who did not return themselves as Hindu have been shown under “ Others It would be natural to suppose that the remaining rebgions might at any rate be regarded as quite distinct  yet while the border line between tribal rebgions and some aspects of Hinduism is not at all easy to draw  it is often just as hard to define it between Hinduism and Islam  and even between Hinduism and Christianity  in the case of a number of intermediate sects which ofier points of identity with both   Except for a body in Tiimevelly that claims to be both Jew and Christian  the Jews remain a much more clearly defined body  and in their case Hindu influence would seem to go no further than inducing the Beni Israel to add a Hindu or a Hinduised second name to the Hebraic one  but the Indian Christians of South India go further  Caste is admittedly observ^ed by Cathobcs   while some ProtesThe Catholics tants who profess not to admit it do admit a ban on commensality  was cause celebre in the Madras in and there a some cases  appear to use caste marks destroyed priest  who had as unchristian an imported courts in which overzealous the wall which ran the length of

use the tali instead of a ring in marriage and permit the retention of other customs  such as a tabu   for reasons of hygiene ” on contacts with persons polluted by childbirth  On the other hand certain features of the Lingayat bebef seem to have been borrowed from Christianity  as a doctrine of immaculate conception and the practice of burying the dead  A forest tribe in North Kanara  now Hindu  has family names of Christian origin  In the case of Islam however the border bne is much less definite  Even saints of Christianity  Islam and Judaism are themselves subject to some confusion  In the Near East Elijah  al Khidr  The Green One  and St  George are confused or identified generally  while boys born on St  Demetrius’ Day are called Kasim  Confusion of this kind is probably to be found among Inclian outcastes such as Lalbegis  who have drawn on both Hindu and Muslim sources for their religious tenets  but it goes still further with the Chet Rami sect  who worship the Christian Trinity plus a Hindu Musbm trinity consisting of Allah the Creator  Parameshwar the Preserver  and Khuda the Destroyer  There is thus a very real difficulty sometimes in deciding whether a particular body is Muslim or Hindu  and since the census actually took jjlace there have been some searchings of heart as to the Sathpantis  or Pirpantis  of Gujarat  of the Punjab   Kachh and Khandesh  These people are Mathia Kunbis by caste  and an offshoot of the Leva Kunbis  and seem to have been returned at the census as Hindus they are said to folloAv the Athar  a Veda  which is perhaps more magical than religious  and thtv worship at the tombs of Muslim saints at Pirana and elsewhere  from which they get the alternative name for their sect  and they observe as their sacred book a collection of the precepts of Imam Shah  the Pir of Pirana they observe the Ramazan  repeat the kalima and bury their dead with both Muslim and Hindu pra yers  On the other hand they keep the holi and diuvli and their marriages are conducted by Brahmans  so that they appear  on the whole  to be Hindus socially but rather iluslims by religion  This position is emphasized by the fact that while a religious authoiity  the Shankaracharya of the Sankeshwar and Karavir Maths  pronounces them to be without the pale of Hinduism  the Hindu Mahasabha  a frankly communal organisation  proclaims that they are within it  Another Hindu organisation has urged these Mathias to abandon the worship of Muslim saints  but in truth mere worship at the burial places of holy men is hardly a test of religion at all  since there are many shrines holy to more than one faith  and the holy ones of one religion often survive the superimposition of another and adapt themselves to the change as Badar Makan  the shrine of a Muslim pir in Chittagong  becomes Buddha Makan to an Arakan Buddhist  So in Paphos the Cypriot peasant worships even the Vii gin Herself as Panhagia Aphroditessa  The truth is that the shrines of the dead are places impregnated with the fert ilis ing soul matterj of the departed great ones ancl the cult of them goes back to a totally pre Hindu phase  which is still represented in the tribal religions  and appears in         At the time of going to press a Catholic  youth is reported to have started a fast to the death outside the residence of the Bishop of Trichinopoly to sesure the removal of the iron railings which separate the caste from the outcaste Catholics in that bishoprick  t See below page 409 for details of the Karen bebef in which this idea is crystalbzed   \f381  AMBIGUOUS SECTS   other practices of some Muslims  the implications of which have been forgotten though the practices remain  as in the use of tombstones of phallic design  which may be seen even in the Khyber Pass  for instance  while the Muslims of Malaya use stone ones of different but likewise significant designs for the different sexes  case not unlike that of the Mathia Kunbis is to be seen in that of the Nayitas of Malwa who “ share in equal degree the Mushm and Hindu religious beliefs ”  worshipping Ganesh as well as Allah  using Hindu names and dress and observing Hindu festivals  It may also be found in the Kuvachandas of Sind and again in the Hussaini Brahmans  who like the Mathias are more or less converted to Islam in faith but retain Brahmanical practices and claim to eat only with the Sayyids among Mus lims The Malkanas of the United Provinces are another somewhat s imil ar group of Rajput  Jat and Bania origin observing both Hindu and Muslim ceremonies  Many became defiiiitel ’ Hindu as a result of the shuddhi movement and others returned themselves as Muslim at the census  but the bulk apparently continue to halt between two opinions  and in 1926 when the shuddhi and tanzim movements were at their height these Malkanas started taking money for conversion and it is said that many made considerable sums by conversion and reconversion to and from Hinduism  Islam and Christianity for which communal zealots were then at any rate able to find money  Bengal affords a number of instances of border line sects such as that of the Bhagwania or Satyadharma community  recruited from both Hindus and Muslims  though even within the sect there is no intermarriage  while the Nagarchis of Bakarganj  the Kirtanias of Pabna and Maimansingh and the Chitrakars or Patuas of West Bengal are in the nature of castes rather than sects  whose rehgion and customs have both Hindu and Mushm features as in the case of the Mathia Kunbis  A fresh movement aimed at the reconcihation of Hinduism and Islam was started during the decade under review by a man who claimed to be an incarnation of Channabasaveswara  but his teachings  though they gained some adherents  aroused much antagonism among the Virasaivas of Mysore State  where the movement started  and led to its suppression   A     Another aspect of the confused border line between Islam and Hinduism is to be seen in the customs of the outcastes of the Punjab  where Chuhras for instance take Muslim names and even utihse the services of mullahs where they serve Muslim villages or wards  though in the eastern Punjab generally they follow Hindu customs and use Hindu names  Yet there is no such marked difference between one Chuhra and the other that a vahd distinction between these two religions can be drawn in his case  At this census it has been left to each individual to return his religion Many he thought fit and some Chuhras have returned Islam others Hinduism  as again have described themselves as belonging to Ad dharm  the original religion ’  probably without any clear idea of what that faith may be  but desiring merely to emphasize the distinction between themselves and caste Hindus without committing themselves to Islam or Christianity  Chuhras in the Punjab who returned their religion as “ Chuhra ” simply  and there were many  have been included with Hindus  following the precedent of the previous census  though it is a moot question whether they should not have been shown as Tribal  and it seems not impossible that they are by origin a degraded branch of the aboriginal tribe known in Gujarat ‘  as Chodhra   Generally speaking  there would seem to be no insuperable reason why the Muslim and the Hindu should not dwell together in harmony  and there are Hindu temples in Madura and Tanjore which have hereditary Muslim trustees  At  any rate the obstacle is probably less the divergence of religious belief than their reliance on different historical pasts  In the early glories of Hinduism and Buddhism  under rulers like Chandragupta and Asoka  Islam has no concern  and the great historic characters of the Muslims in India were mostly earth seizing monarchs whose victories were over Hindus and whose culture was of external origin   160  Part of the  difficulty of defining the term Hindu arises from the fact that system it is as much a social as a religious term and really denotes membership of a that practices  so it is religious beliefs and of organized society with great latitude of shared have religious belief ydth and a to possible for a man to be a Hindu socially others who do not regard themselves as members of the same society  a possibility illustrated by a tribal Korwa of the Central Provinces who said to his Census ”  Conversely there Superintendent “ if we had plough cattle we should be Hindus share his beliefs  society should of his others is no compelling necessity that all  ^  “  ’  \f     CHAPTER XI   382  and the Census Superintendent defines a Hindu  of   RELIGION  Mysore  State   himself a  Brahman  thus     “ tChat makes a man Hindu is the fact that he is an Indian by birth   that he shares religious of the people   that he is a member of the social order  belief of a kind familiar to the majority  accepted by that majority   and that he worships one or o^her of the deities in the pantheon commonly accepted by that same majority ”  This is a feature particularly associated with Hinduism but it is not exclusiv ely confined to that religion  as at least one case arose of a Muslim who wished to be included with the social community of Islam but who returned his religion as Agnosticism  He appears to have been unique and his difficulty was evaded by showing him as a Muslim for all tables except that of religion  a position which recalls that of ilaurice Barres who said of himself “ I am an atheist  but of course 1 am a Catholic ”  but the number of Hindus whose attitude to their community and their beliefs might be expressed in a somewhat similar paradox must be very large  and the cross division of religion and society is clearly going to create a ” difficult position for census operations in the future unless a return of “ community be substituted for that of religion and caste  Thus the Sahejdhari Sikhs who worship the ninth Guru but not the tenth  and who cut their hair instead of allowing it to grow  form a sect half way between the Hindu and Sikh religions and for census purposes had to declare themselves to belong to one or to the other with the result that some are included in the Hindu and others in the Sikh total  but no substitute for “ Hindu ” as a religious term can be found  nor is it possible to This is inherent in the history disentangle its religious from its social significance  of Hindu society which has been formed by the accretion of a number of It is probably significant that many races within a polity indirectly hierarchical  an ignorant Hindu  if asked his religion  will not give “ Hindu ” as an answer but will give the  name of his caste or of the particular sect to which he belongs   As  far as Sikhs go  the criteria that separate them from Hindus are not very marked  on the social side  whatever they may be doctrinally  The daughter of a Sikh ruler can marry a cadet of the house of Nepal  and Hindus can enter the Golden TempleIndeed there of Amritsar which is normally barred to Muslims and Christians  are apparently cases in which a father may bring up one son as a Hindu and another The Sikhs in general  however  emphatically protest that they are not as a Sikh  Hindus  in spite of the Hindu Mahasabha which says that they are  and this is particularly so in the case of the Akali Sikhs  who are mainstay of the Sikhs in the army  while the Sahejdhari Sikhs vote in Sikh constituencies in the Punjab on making a solemn affirmation that they are Sikhs  Buddhists were claimed as Hindus by the Hindu Mahasabha with less justice than Sikhs  since Buddhism arose as a definite reaction against Hinduism  and considerations of politics have probably been allowed to bias the critical faculty in putting forward this claim  since it may be doubted whether even the Hindu Mahasabha would claim all Japanese Buddhists as Hindus  The common element in the two religions  and this is of course apparent  even to the parallel between the Indian holi and the chaster Burmese Water Carnival  is often derived from a more primitive religion  but to claim Buddhists as Hindus by religion appears to the disinterested just about as reasonable as it would be to claim Christians as Jews  When they do not split away like the Sikhs  there seems to be a tendency for reforming elements in Hinduism to crystalhze eventually into a closed caste  This has been the case with the Lingayats  who started as a reforming sect of Hindus founded by Basava in the twelfth century  with rhe Kabirpanthis and with others  the Vaisnava sect in Bengal for instance  and probably would have been the case with the Sikhs had they remained within the pale  In the case of the Brahmo and Arya Samajists  however  neither are closed but on the contrary recruit steadily from among Brahmanic Hindus nevertheless there appeared some tendency on the part of one section of the Arya Samaj to disclaim Hinduism at this census  though the schism between Aryas and orthodox Hindus is perhaps less marked on the whole than when the Arya movement started  which is perhaps due to a weakening Of this weakening ’  if the term be permissible  of the strictly orthodox position  the Census Superintendent of Cochin State writes  a little pessimistically perhaps     ‘  as follows     “ Broadly speakiiig  a two fold movement is discernible in this connection  AtnoTig those placed in the lower grades of Hindu society it is a movement for the purification and elevation of their religious rites and practices   wffile those horn in the higher grades reveal a  \fREFORMING MOVEMENTS   383  growing indifference in all matters connected with religion To the generality of Englisheducated persons be it remembered in this connection that the caste Hindus have progressed much more than aU others in English education religion is now a matter of utter indifference or unconcern and its rites and practices a mass of superstition to be derided and condemned by all right thinking people Apart from this  the attitude of a great majority of the English educated young men of caste Hindu communities towards their religion is now one of veiled hostility because  in these days of communal demand for equal representation of all creeds and classes the public service  they find that the unlucky accident of their birth withiri the Hindu fold is an almost impassable barrier against their entry in government or quasigovernment service  the only career for which they are fit by training and temperament alike ”        m  The Jains  as already pointed out  were claimed as Hindus with more reason  since some Jains do actually consider themselves to be Hindus  though their customs of succession and adoption are not the same as those in Hindu law  It seems probable indeed that this sect rep resentsthe continuity of an anti Brahmanistic teaching which may trace its derivation to a pre Vedic age and to opposition at the outset to the rise of Brahmanic Hinduism  It is not likely that Maharira was 161  Jainisim      regarded as the 23rd tirtkankara gratuitously  in spite of his having been the first historical one of the series and the apparent founder of the rehgion  Moreover  this view of the Jain position would explain how it is that although the teaching of Mahavira was emphatically antivedic  the rules of Jain and of Brahmanic asceticism are almost identical  if the suggestion be accepted  that is  which is generally advanced here  that Brahmanic Hinduism was not an entirely new rehgion imported from outside by Indo European invaders into a country peopled by darkskinned savages  but an indigenous growth produced by the impact of these invaders  having a rehgion akin to that of classical Greece and Rome  upon a pre existing more civilized people with a rehgion drawn from Mesopotamia  Asia Minor or the eastern Mediterranean  It may be noted incidentally that such a hypothesis would do something towards reconciling the difficulty in that whereas the Jains describe the Tirthankara Parswa who preceded Mahavira as the son of a king Aswasena of Benares  no king of that name is known to Brahmanical hterature except a king Professor Tucci’s opinion that Jainism embodies a revival of of the “ Nagas ”  very ancient rituals and forms “ probably even pre Aryan ”  goes to support the same view  and it cannot be denied that the nudity cult of the Digambar Jains is of great antiquity  much older than the familiar accounts of Megasthenes of the This nudity cult still causes local sensations from time to time 3rd century B C  and some Jain munis were in April 1931 charged with indecency in the Court of The case was withdrawn on an understanding given the City Magistrate at Surat  by ihe Jains that such ‘‘ sky clad ” ascetics should only move about in public siuTOundcd by a discreet bodyguard  In May however in Dholpur State the appearance of sky clad Jains in the village of Rajakhera  where the populace was less The Jain like the Hindu community is not tolerant  gave rise to a serious riot  unmoved by the spirit of reform  and opinion has run very high on the question of the initiation of minors as religious ascetics  muni   leading in Ahmadabad to blow s between the two factions in July 1930 and to action by the Magistrate w ho had to take security against breaches of the peace in January 1931   162 Some indications of a tendency to change and reform have appeared in the other important religious communities  even the Parsis having apparently experienced dissensions between the Shenshais and the Kadmis  and between the supporters and opponents of Bahaism  while as an instance of the change effected by modern means of transport it is interesting to note that the holy fire for a Parsi temple at Allahabad was brought from Bombay in a specially consecrated motor In Islam an lorry in which the sacred fire was fed wdth sandalwood by a priest  Hanafi resulted Ahl i Hadis sect on the sect in criminal prosecution  the a attack by and the Dawudi Borah sect w^as divided by a fatwa which excommunicated those members of the society who might forbear to wear beards  The insignificance however of dissensions of this kind serves merely to emphasize the general unity of the community as a w hole  and the Christian conmiunities of India  who  Roman Catholics apart  show  sects as multifarious as those of Hinduism  have made a notable    movement towards unity in the attempt  partially if not completely successful  to unite the Wesleyan  Congregational and Presbyterian communities into a Hnited Church  or rather into two united churches  those of Southern and Northern India It was hoped that the figures of Christian sects would be available and effect of this unifying movement from w hich certain extent the to show bodies withheld themselves  but unfortunately the necessity three those of seetions 2c M22CC  respectively   Reforming movementi   \f384  CHAPTER XI    ^RELIGION   for economy at the abstraction stage prohibited the necessary sort being made  Similarly separate figures are not available for the Angbcan Communion  the form  under which were returned members of the Church of England and of the newly established independent branch of that community in India  The disestablishment of the Anglican Church in India  which will in future be independent of the State  as well as of the ecclesiastical control of the Church of England  and will receive  no aid from Government as in the past  is too recent for its consequences to be foreseen  but it is possible that it will seek to unite with the other united Protestant communities  while it is also not unlikely that its sympathies politically will be definitely nationalist  Among Catholics exception was taken to the separate return of Catholics of the Chaldaean and of the Latin rite  As it was impossible to include the Catholics of the Chaldaean rite among Roman Catholics generally and also to show them as S Tian Christians  and as from their history and traditions the Syrians as a whole form a striking and important community in Southern India  where they have been established as long as Christianity has in most parts of Europe  and have quite as much right to be regarded as an indigenous religious body as have Muslims and Parsis  the Catholics of Chaldaean rites were shown as a separate unit  other S3rTians being taken together like the Protestants  These other Syrians include Nestorians  whose numbers have been much depleted by secessions to the Jacobites and to Rome Jacobites  who form the next largest Syrian body to Romans of the Chaldaean rite Reformed or Mar Thoma Sju ians  and a small schismatic body known as Yuyomayam  The Jacobite community has been rent since 1910 by a schism resulting from the exconimunication by the Patriarch of Antioch of the Jacobite metropolitan Mar Dionysius  who refused to recognise the decree or to surrender his temporalities or to submit to the findings of the secular court  which in turn adjudicated on the case  About the time the census was taken the Patriarch came to India and the good offices of Lord Irwin were obtained and the decree of excommunication was revoked and a synod was called to arrange for a reconciliation of the divisions which the schism had caused  The Catholics of Chaldaean rites have had Indian bishops from their own community since 1896  but during the decade preceding this census the first Indian bishop of Latin rites was also appointed  1923   There is also now an Indian bishop of the American Episcopal INIethodist Church  The part played by the Indian Christians in the nationalist movement is not without importance  and it is during the past decade that their attitude has tended to change from that of a separatist minority towards co operation with the moderate nationalists  a change expressed by the formation of a Christian Nationalist Party in Bombay  163  One difficulty which was little felt at this census as compared with some previous ones was the temporary displacement of population by great pilgrimages  Religious pilgrimages play a greater feature in Indian life than in the life of any other nation  though they have always been popular on the shores of the Mediterranean  Even the very ancient   dgrimages to St  James of Compostella however and the modern ones to the grotto of Lourdes are probably insignificant compared to such assemblies as the Kumbh mela at Allahabad  which occurred fortunately This pilgrimage habit  for in India it is nothing less  in 1930 and not in 1931  appears to be maintained by regular and hereditary canvassers attached to different shrines  vho go round the country inducing villagers to leave everything and embark  sometimes with their families as well  on visits to distant shrines and tours of holy places which may even take years to accomplish  The shrines undoubtedly benefit  but it is impossible not to speculate as to whether the moral or physical benefit of the pilgrim is proportionate to the loss in time  in labour and in expense  though the justice of such a materialistic reflection is perhaps questionable when made by one who has not himself experienced the religious emotion inspired in the pilgrims  Canvassing  however  is not always needed to start a pilgrimage  In February 1930 the gas generated by night soil in a trenching ground near Delhi issued from the earth in flame  and the spot promptly became the scene of a local pilgrimage to the goddess favoured site  large numbers of people of the more ignorant classes coming and removing mephitic earth from the empyreumatic spot hallowed  as some The goddess in this case proved obligingly said  by the goddess of small pox susceptible of chemical analysis  which showed that her ambrosial composition was 70 per cent  methane  20 per cent  carbon dioxide and 10 per cent  inert gases  164  If  however  the cen sus was untroubled by pilgrimages or great fairs it had other troubles to meet fiom religious sentiment to which allusion has already       PUgrbnaget   Fropaganda   \fPKOPA6ANBA  been made   385  There was the energetic propaganda by the Hindu Mahasabha which  practically amounted to an advocacy of returning as Hindu every person whose religion could not be found to have been originated outside India  that is practically every one but Muslims  Christians  Parsis and Jews  regardless of whether the  followers of other Indian religions wished to be returned as Hindu or not  and equallv regardless of the facts of the case  They also proposed to include as Hindus all persons of doubtful position half way between Hinduism and Islam  without insisting on the shuddhi ceremony  In the fear apparently that the depressed classes would not be returned as Hindus attempts were also made to minimise their numbers  though it is only fair to say that the depressed classes organizations were not behind hand in claiming as “ depressed ” a number of castes almost certainly not Non Hindu hill tribes such as the Khasi of Assam were claimed in that category  as Hindus  though one Assam paper naivety distinguished between ’kiiicha and Hindus  while a proposal was actually mooted by certain members of the j ucca Central Legislature that wherever the majority of the members of a hill tribe had been Hinduised  the complete tribe should be shown as Hindu  It was not suggested that where a minority were Hindu the whole tribe sh ould be returned as Tribal  ‘  ’  ’  ‘  though this may of co ixse have been  im plied   Bombay regards the figure of Tribal Religions  The Census Superintendent for  that   rovince  155 0 38  “ grossly understated ” and thus accounts for their deficiency for  as     “ Whenever an individual disclaims membership of any recognised religion  the tendency is to enter Hindu without further enquiry  more particularly if the individual in question is undoutyedly a member of a tribe  long established in the locality  The proce ss of thought is something as  This land is called Hindustan and is the country of the Hindus  and all who live in it must he Hindus unlessthey definitely claim another recognised religion  This attitude jx rvades all grades of Hindu Society and 1 have been questioned on this basis  as to the propriety of the instructions issued  by many Hindus  including Government officers  who po ssessed the Though they submitted to the qualification of B A  and who held the rank of Mamlatdar  orders given  there is little doubt that these orders were not pas sed on in their entirety and with the It is certain that the very clarity necessary to impress them upon all Enumerators vast bulk of the Bhils  Katkaris and Thakurs in this Presidency are not Hindus  It cannot also be denied that Bhils and Thakurs  living in isolated groups in Hindu villages are gradually yielding to the influence of association and conforming to the rite s of Hindu worship as practised locally but in the absence of adequate data it is impossible to compute the number of persons who have abandoned their primitive beliefs and adopted Hinduism in their place  My personal view is that the process of assimilation is very slow  much slower than is commonly believed to be the case  even in areas where individual members of the Aboriginal Tribes have descended into the plains and are brought into contact wth all the influence of village life ”  follows  ^Vbat took place in Assam is typical and it is simplest to quote the Census Superintendent himself    “ Just before the census I received several petitions from Kacharis in Karnrup stating that they had been returned as Hindus in the census schedules and that they objected to the action The Census Officer in forwarding the of the enumerators recording their religion as Hindm petitions noted as follows and 1 think his note sums up exactly what went on in mo st distiict s of ‘It h true to some extent that due to propaganda by the Hindu Sabha the Assam Valley some of the Kacharis have willingly allowed themselves to be recorded a s Hindu bv religion in some cases some of the enumerators have persuaded them to have themselves recorded as such and in some cases some of the enumerators have recorded thciu as such of their own accord  they being ignorant of what was recorded of them             The Census Superintendent continues “ The propaganda work of the Ifindu Mission was certninly a gree t succe ^^ in Assam from their point of  dew and had an enormous influence on the tribal peoj les hovering in the borderland s  me Lah ings ci  w  t j ms  me in Xowgong between Hinduism and Animism  my advice as to how they should relurn their religion  T que Uioned them about their

rctuen their religion as Lalung  In spite  hov  ever  of  dih resolution the in January 1930 and asked     vast majority of Lain ngs returned themselves as Hindus  in many cases  I have no doubt  But there can be no doubt that manv  iiumerator  i under th  influence of the propaganda entered Hindu against the names of tribal persons who found it difficult to state precisely what their religion was and if there was any doubt Hinduism got the benefit of it  voluntarily   the Deputy Commissioner reports that InDarrang he had good reason to suspect a Charge Superintendent a Government officer of using his influence to get Aniniist Kueharis returned as Hindus ”     M22CC     2c2  \f   CHAPTER XI   386   ^RELIGION   In anotlier passage the Census Superintendent remarks that attempts were made to return as Hindus even the Naga and Kuki tribes of the North Cachar Hills  and he quotes as follows from the Deputy Commissioner of Darrang District       “ The Hindu enumerator  and they are nearly all Hindus  tends to record all animistic and  Even if the enuaboriginal tribes  such as Kacharis  Mikirs  Mundas and Santhals  as Hindus  merator fads  the supervisor or checking officer tends to keep him up to the scratch  An instance was brought to my notice at Halem where the enumerator had written Miri  but the checldng officer changed it to Hindu Hiri There is no remedy though I have done what I can the ‘     enumerator  if questioned  says that they say they are Hindus  In the great majority of cases I do not imagine they do say so  Those I have asked say  in the great majority of cases  that they are  e  9   of the Miri religion  The net result must be that the religion statistics collected at this census will be very inaccurate in areas where there are animistic or aboriginal tribes ” ‘  ’  Agitation among the Gonds and Oraons resulted in a large number  who were returned as Tribal in 1921  particidarly of the former  returning themselves or being returned as Hindus  though their Hinduism in parts of the areas concerned is highly problematical  In the ease of the Gonds in Berar alone these rather dubious Hindus numbered over 100 000  and in the Central Provinces and Berar together they amounted to more than three lakhs  In India as a whole the tribesmen who changed from Tribal religions to Hinduism numbered a milhonand a half   In Gwalior State over 14 000 Bhils in the remoter forests and hills  whose tribal name was returned as their religion  were classified notwithstanding as “ Hinduized Tribal ” and included in the total of Hindus  involving a total transfer from “ Tribal ” in 1921 to “ Hindu in 1931 of some 162 000 Bhils  In Cochin State some 5 000 hill or forest tribesmen were classified as Hindu ’ though very doubtfully conforming to such a description  and a similar procedure has probably been followed elsewhere  On the other hand again counter agitation in the Punjab against being returned as Hindu led 400 000 of the depressed castes to return themselves as Ad DJiarmi  i e   “ of the original faith as distinct from the terms used by their congeners of other provinces in northern India Adi Hindu  an expression which allowed of their inclusion in the total of Hindus  correctly of course  since in spite of their disabihties they are Hindu by religion  and if not  would not agitate for admission to Hindu templesf  Feeling on the subject of the return of religion ran highest in the Punjab  where many attempts were made to weight the census  False statements were circulated probably to arouse enthusiasm  such as a canard that all the sweepers of Simla had been returned as IMuslims  which was published as a fact before even the preliminary enumeration of Simla had begun  A good deal of heat was similarly engendered on the question of the Udasi Sadhus  Members of this sect at one time regarded themselve s gxmerally as Sikhs  but since then they have reverted to the original fold and are now Hindus  Unfortunately an obsolete direction was reproduced in the Punjab Census Code from 1921 directing the inclusion of Udasis a s Sikhs in the absence of information to the contrary  This was at once withdrawn when the circumsTances were made clear  A great deal of misunderstanding was also arou sed by the provision in the Code that Aryas and Brahmos should riot be entered in the schedule as Hindu  This provision is an old one and is merely intended to faci  date the sorting of the Brahmo and Arya slips  but it was assumed by lunn   ructvd person s who obtained access to the Code that the provision was intended to exclude Brahmo ^ and Aryas from the Hindu total  which was not of course the ‘     case   In Benual even eompilaiion wa s subject to propaganda and in one sortinf^ bad been made for copving slips

tribes in that provmce  The table  see below paragraph 173  Tribal  hardly shows complete figures for the change  as it can only give the numbers of those tribes which returned their tribe in column 8 of the schedule  and there were certainly many Christians who did not do so and probably appreciable numbers of Hindus  On the other hand against the increase from these sources must be set off some decrease due to defection from orthodox Hinduism to the Arya or Brahmo Samaj  though the total figure of Hindus is not thereby afiected  to the exclusion of the Ad Dharmis already explained  and perhaps in some small degree to the conIt  “hould be version of the depressed castes and others to Islam or Christianity  the term Brah manic censuses includes as used at this and past pointed out that and orthodox Hindus of also many  recognised Hindu sects but not only Sanatanists ‘  ’  ‘     such as Lingayats  Kabirpanthis or the Jugi caste of Assam  who do not recognise  Brahmanic authority  Similarly the increase of Aryas is to be attributed to the adhesion of Hindus drawn very largely but by no means entirely from the lower ‘Brahmanic ranks of Hindu souety  wirich find in the Arya Sauiaj an opportunity of rising socially without abandoning Hinduism  since the Arya Samaj does not attach that importance to caste which is characteristic of orthodox Brahmanism  This reason was given for the increase of Aryas in Kashmir from 1 000 in 1911 to 23 000 in 1921  their present figures being 94 000  The Arya Samaj has been the most active of the Hindu prosehdising bodies  and the All India Shuddhi Conference  meeting under its auspices at the Kumbh Mela of 1930 at Allahabad  propormded  if correctly reported  the amazing proposition that “ it is an rmdisputed fact that the founders of all the religions of the world were either Hmdus or their descendants and it appealed for the reconversion of who drifted away from the present body their followers in the interests of the future progress of mankind  ‘  The Brahmo Samaj is a more eclectic body with a better claim to provide a catholic religion in that it does not insist on the infallibility  of the Vedas  but inculcates the worship of one God  Creator and Preserver  who punishes sin remedially  and soul   to be served in prayer and moral conduct  a belief in the immortality of the and the view that no prophet  and no scriptures of any religion are finally and  is  It is probable that the very broadness of this creed exclusively authoritative  militates against its appeal to any but the most intellectual classes  and though there are a number of Brahmo missions the increase by conversion is very much less numerically than that effected by the Arya Samaj Its position in Hinduism    both religiously and socially offers a near parallel to that of the Unitarians in Christianity in Britain  SIkhf   166   The increase of 33 9% under this head cannot be regarded as an entirely  natural increase of population

and Aroras  even in the eastern part of the Punjab  This conversion seems to have been partly due to the impression that there was something to be gained by belonging to a community comparatively speaking little represented in Government services  and cases are actually reported in which some sons are brought up as Hindus and others as Sikhs so as to better the opportunities of the family as a whole in the search for posts under Government  How far the figures given represent a complete return of Sikhs it is not easy to say  as it is not known whether the Sahejdhari Sikhs generally returned themselves as Sikhs oi Hindus  The orders given to enumerators were that a return of “ Sikh  Hindu ” would not be accepted  and that the person enumerated must decide in which body he would be returned  The probability is that the bulk of the Sahejdhari Sikhs returned themselves as Hindus in Baluchistan and in the hi  W  F  P  but it is doubtful if such is the case in the Punjab where the Sahejdhari is recognised as a Sikh for electoral purposes if he desires to be so regarded  The figures of Sikhs in Sind show a remarkable fluctuation from census to census  largely on account of the varying classification of the Sahejdhari  Thus in 1 881  127 000 Sikhs were censused in Sind  in 1891 under a thousand  in 1901 „  census year   A   V  Actual number 1                      T  Increase

shown in the marginal table above  Their fertUity is probably higher than that of Hindus on account of later marriage and the free remarriage of widows  The great bulk of the Sikhs shown as such in the census reports belong to the Keshadhari or Akali division which outnumbered those Sahejdhari who returned themselA’ es as Sikhs in 1921 by about 1 200%  A noticeable feature in connection with the Sikhs is their appreciable increa   e in centres distant from the Punjab  to which they migrate largely for the sake of emplojment as mechanics  The phenomenal increase of over 30% in the Punjab itself  must be largely ascribed to the inclusion by conversion of Hindu castes  167  The Jain community is gradually decreasing in number proportionately This is probably due in jiart to the to the population of the countwv as a whole  practice of child marriage and the prohibition of widow  remarriage  and partly also to the small size of the community which  attracting as it does no adherents

Course  be entirely disentangled that of race  and the views expressed here must be read with those in the  Subsequent chapter  but it may be  convenient to state here briefly the general  \f\f   \fHINDUISM AND PRIMITIVE RELIGION   393  hypothesis reached  That is that a number of successive racial intrusions into and occupations of India have contributed to the elements now found in the Hindu religion  which took its final form as the result of the impact of the social ascendency of the Indo European invaders of the 2nd millenium B  C  on pre existing religious institutions  The first occupants of India were probably Negritos  and elements of their belief  perhaps including the reverence for the pipal tree and possibly a primitive phallic fertility cult  may have been perpetuated by the proto australoids who were the next comers and probably contributed the totemic theory  or at least the basis thereof  The next elements were probably of Mediterranean origin contributing a phallic and a megalith ic culture and the life essence theory  but the relative positions of the Dr avidian  speaking Mediterranean  j Armenoid  the proto australoid and the Munda and Mon Khmer or Austroasiatic races is difficult to determine and there is little material from which to draw a conclusion  and many would identify the protoaustraloid and Mrmda racial elements  If the Munda speaking elements be distinct from the proto australoid  it would be conveniently  orderly to suppose that the Mundas came after them with a life essence theory and the Mediterraneans still later to develop it into reincarnation  and bringing in the worship of the tJreat Mother  but it is conceivable that the Mediterraneans brought both the theory and its development and the Munda came later as a barbarian invader  though no doubt already in possession of the soul matter philosophy  since at any rate the hill tribes of Assam  Burma and Indo China appear to contain an element of Caucasian stock which penetrated to the S  E  of Asia before the southern migration of Mongolians of the Pareoean branch  and the soul matter theory must have arisen very  early in the history  of the human race  Both Munda and Mediterranean must have been followed by religious elements from Asia Minor  brought via Mesopotamia by traders and settlers from the west  which superseded the fertility  and soulmatter cult by one of personified deities  sacrificial propitiation and a formalised worship  again with phallic elements and such institutions as that of the deva dasi  vide supra para  102   together with astronomical lore and cults of the heavenly bodies and priestly  institutions which formed the basis of modern Hinduism  the final form of which was determined by  the successful conflict of this proto Hinduism on the religious side with the imported religion of the “ Ary an   invaders  to whom  however  it had to concede much socially   resulting in the socio religious position of the priestly  order so familiar in India   The generally accepted view of the Hindu religion or society’ regards it as Aryan invaders of about B  C  1500 who came in with a higher civilization and a fairer skin to find the great peninsula inhabited by  dark skinned barbarians on whom they imposed the religion of the Vedas  It is more than doubtful if this view can any longer be accepted  and the doubts cast on it appear to be confirmed by recent discoveries including that of a figure of Shiva among the remains at Mohenjodaro  while Sir John Marshall has clearly shown that the pre Ary an religion of the Indus valley involved a cult of the bull  and of the snake ty pical Mediterranean cults  to be found in Crete and also of phallic sy mbols  including “ ring ” and baety lic stones  which are probably all part of the soul fertility  cult which is associated throughout India with menhirs  dolmens and a megalithic culture originating in        generally indeed Heine Geldern connects the megalithic My cenean theatre with India and so with the Far East and the Pacific Islands  It has been pointed out with some aptness that in modern Hinduism only those elements of Vedic rites have survived which are essentially social  such as the marriage ceremonies the argument being that though society was  or aimed at being  Ary an  its religion is older than that of the so called Aryan invasion  The god of the Rigveda Indo Europeans is Indra  the thunder god  who fills in later developments an entirely minor role  apparently being absorbed into the Hindu pantheon just as the minor gods of primitive tribes have been  retaining  however  his personal identity by vutue of a social prestige or privilege which other tribal gods have lost in the process of assimilation  The historical Hindu religion first appears not in the Punjab  which must be regarded as the area most completely oc cupied by the Indo European uivaders  but to the east of that in the Brahmarshidesha where stable fusion between these Indo European invaders and the previous inhabitants probably took place  WEen alien cultures and religions fuse to form a new culture or religion  it will not be found that this fusion takes place where the intrusive culture is strong enough to predominate  It will rather appear away from the centre where the intrusion is strongest  in some area where the previous culture was strong enough to resist       \fCHAPTER XI   394   RELIGIOK   complete suppression and make its influence felt on tke new one  Thus it is that the efflorescence of Hellenic culture took place not in Sparta  where was the purest blood of the northern invaders  but in Athens where the grasshopper wearing inhabitants regarded themselves as autochthones and where there was probably efiective fusion between the fair haired northerner and the dark haired Pelasgian  Similarly there is some reason to believe that Home grew from a fusion between the ancient Etruscans and later invaders  whether the latter came from the east or from the north  In the same way it k suggested that Hindu religion and society finally took form and flourished as a result of the impact of the invading Indo European on the indigenous religion that he found in India  It is quite clear that the pre^ ious inhabitants of India lived in cities and had a high civilization  probably of western Asiatic origin  and it is significant that Hinduism is remarkable for the similarity of many of its tenets and practices to those of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia  The indigenous religion of any country inevitably starts with an advantage over that of an invading people  since it is the priest of the country who knows how to approach the gods of the soil and propitiate them  and for that reason there is always a tendency for a local religion to establish its ascendency over an intrusive one  This appears to hai e been the case in India where the important position of Shiva  Vishnu and Kali  as compared to the unimportant one which Indra now holds  Signalizes the triumph of the older gods  The religious history of pre Vedic India was probably similar and parallel to that of the eastern Mediterranean and Prof  Tucci points out that though the moon does not appear to of Asia Minor  have been an independent divinity  ancient lunar cults have been assimilated by Devi in the forms of Durga  Kali and Tripura sundari  The cult of snakes  the worship of a mother goddess were probably brought in by earlier invaders of Mediterranean or of Armenoid race  speaking no doubt a Dravidian language  whose religion must also be associated with fertility cults  phallic symbohsm  the Devadasi cult and probably human sacrifice  Kecent discoveries in Crete have revealed a remarkalDle snake cult associated with the^ symbol of the double axe  With Mesopotamia too we must perhaps associate a moon god and sun goddess whose sex was changed with a change from matrilineal to patrilineal descent perhaps under the influence of the Rigvedie invaders  It is worth pointing out that the deification and worship of kings  very tyiucal of the Hindu attitude to kingship  is stated by Langdon  J  R  A  S   1931  page 367  to be characteristic of Sumerian It would also appear not characteristic of the religion in contrast to Semitic  religion of the Rigveda  but on the contrary to be connected with the beliefs in the external soul and in life es sence discussed below  inasmuch as the king contains or represents the life principle of the community he rules  Like the cult of the snake the transmigration of souls too appears to be a doctrine in no way typical of northern religions in which the dead live on underground  and Fustel de Coulanges has pointed out that it is not a feature of any northern religion though it has survived and been incorporated in them from the more ancient religions of Greece and Italy  Ancestor worship again is very strong in India and this too would appear foreign to northern Euro  ean religion  and indeed it is almost impossible that nomads should be ancestor worshippers  and the Aryan invasion  so called  was probably  an invasion of steppe dwelling tribes  pastoral in habit and still nomadic  Cremation they may have brought in and if so  they gave it a social cachet which is still leading to its gradual adoption by tribes which have previously practised burial or exposure  but it seems much more likely that the Rigvedie Aryans buried their dead and adopted cremation from the inhabitants whom they  conquered  The 8th book of the Rigveda contains the following words addressed to the dead “ I place this barrier  of stones  for the living that no other may go beyond May they live a hundred numerous autumns  keeping death at a  distance by it  Enter the mother earth this hill Earth  let his breath rise upward Even as a mother co  ers her son with the end oppress him not  easily  may these homes of her cloth  so do ye  earth  cover him for all I heap up earth above thee  etc   ”  Rajendralala time be his asylum Mitra Indo Aryans  II  123   This passage seems very clearly to indicate burial in a tumulus  and the word translated barrier is stated in a note to be paridhi which    ’  ’  may mean part of a circle of stones   It is true that the 10th hymn of the Rigveda clearly refers to cremation  but the author above quoted rightly regards it as the later passage  and suggests that ritual exigencies involved the dislocation of the verses and their fusion for ceremonial purposes in the Yajurveda and the  Sutras  \f395  KIGVEDIC BURIAI    the reference to inhumation being then interpreted as indicating the burial of the It app ears  however  quite clear that the hymn quoted above can only refer ashes  to the inhumation of the body  and that this practice as well as that of cremation was in use at the time of the Rigveda  while cremation is not mentioned until the 10th hymn  admittedly a much later composition than the earlier ones cremation also seems definitely to have been the practice in the Indus valley of the iMohenjodaro period  and therefore the more likely one of the two to have been adopted as an alternative by the Rigvedic Aryan s at their period of fusion with the preexisting The Aryan sanctity of fire  seems likely to have been incompatible population  with cremation  and it will be remembered that Herodotus taxes Cambyses with impiety for having had the body of Amasis burned ‘‘for the Persians regard for they fire as a god and therefore to burn the dead is on no account allowed say that it is not right to offer to a god the corpse of a man ” It may be noticed both that Wilson  Infanticide in Western India  74  remarks of the Eajpuits of Kachh and Kathiawar that they encouraged their concubines to commit sati in preference to their wives and actually gives as the reason that sati was a custom of low castes and therefore derogatory to Rajputs  and also that Rajputs in Gujarat who forbid widow remarriage are called Vdnkd  crooked and those who allow it Pddhrd  straight  Bombay Gazetteer  IX  i  page 123 n      ‘  ‘  ’  With Asia Minor or Mesopotamia again we must associate astronomy and the  worship of the heavenly bodies  which form an important part of Hindu culture  and Sun wmrship appears to be less important in in particular the cult of the moon god  the Rigveda than at a later date when the Bhavishya Purana is largely devoted to a It is however possible that it was the influence of Rigvedic invaders cult of the srm  which changed the sex of the sun from female to male and gave rise to the sun descended In Rigveda Soma the moon is nobility as distinct from the moon  descended  The name of the represented as ma le and as marrying Surya the daughter of the Sun latter suggests that the Sun himself  Surya  was originally the female that married the Moon and that there has been a change of sex associated in so many parts of the world with variations of the Phaethon legend  Similarly again the existing holy places of the Hindus are outside Brahmavarta where one might have expected to find them  if it were really the fact that the religion actually arose in that area  while to find them elsewhere is con sistent wth a  fiew that they are places regarded with devotion by the religions which preceded the invasion  This view is sometimes emphasised by the existence of Hindu shrines where priests and custodians are not Brahmans but some pseudo Brahman or Sudra caste  e g  the Mails who are the officiating priests of some Orissa temples and probably the Panda Brahmans It is doubtless significant that sacrifice of cattle was “ detested of the same region  ” by the public though enjoined by the earlier vedas  the inference from which is that the reverence paid to cattle predates the Rigvedic invasion  and Buddhism and Jainism  the latter of which contains extremely aiicient ceremonial survivals  may represent a reaction towards the pre Vedic religion to Avhich the majority  of tlie inhabitants of rorthern India were attached and which was modified but not destroyed by contact vnth the invaders  The first prohibition of cow killing seems to be found in the comparatively late Atharva Veda and to be applied speciallv if not exclusively to Brahmans  while elsewhere we learn that the cow  although a fit offering for Mitra and Vanina  should not be sacrificed because such sacrifice is opposed to public feeling  a clear indication of the contrast between the rel’gions of the socially superior Arjmn invaders and the cattle cherishing inhabitants who formed the bulk of the population  In Southern India  the Census Superintendent “ the cow is as much revered in those areas of the presidency for Madras points out  with the lightest tincture of Brahmanism as in those more affected ”  which mav be taken to indicate that reverence for the cow in India is older than the Vedic In any case the sanctity of the cow is foreign to the Rigveda and religion ” appears far more suggestive of the religions of Asia l Tinor  Eg^qit and Crete than of the Indo European invaders who came from the steppes of the north west to conquer northern India in the strength of their horses and of their iron  Indra moreover appears as the author of sacrifice and in the Yajur Veda it seems still to be Indra and Varuna who are the principal recipients of sacrificed cattle  It does not seem possible to accept Sir John Marshall’s antithesis between the worship of the bull and the worship of the cow  Both are surely different aspects of the same reverence for cattle which characterises the pre equine civilisations of the  X     \f396  CHAPTER XI    RELIGION   Mediterranean basin  and in India are pre “ Aryan ” in origin  The Vedas after all enjoined gaumedha  and the Black Yajiir Veda lays down an elaborate list of deities to whom bulls  oxen and cows can be appropriately sacrificed  Vishmi  Shiva and Kali the great gods of Hinduism are not Rigvedic deities at all  Sakti is probably a cult derived from the Great Mother goddess of Asia Minor  and the cult of Shiva is ine^dtably associated with it  the two being bound up with the phallic religion of southern Asia and of the eastern Mediterranean  It is probably significant that the word linga is definitely of non  Aryan origin  as Przyluski has demonstrated  while the word jmja is also believed to be a non Sanskritic loan word  With the worship of Shiva  too  is to be associated the snake cult of which there are so many survivals in southern India and v’hich appears to have been at an early date in definite opposition to Brahmanistic Hinduism  the conflict between the two being indicated  for instance  by Ivrishna’s exploits against serpents  by the destruction of serpents at the burning of the forests of Khandava and the slaughter of serpents in the Mahabharata  V ^ishnu  apparently a post Rigvedic god  is perhaps the fruit of the reaction of what we may call proto Hinduism to the Rigvedic invaders  as also the present ascendency of male over female conceptions of the deity  and Przyluski in one of his most recent essavs  Archiv Orientdhii   f P  2  August 1932  ascribes a Dra vidian origin to the name Vishnu At the same time Vishnu would seem to ha  e some associations with religious beliefs which must be regarded as represented chiefly in beliefs yet siuviving among primitive tribes  Indra apparently is himself declared in tlie iMahabharata to be guilty of brahmanicide in killing Vrtra and Xamuci who were Danavas  though the Rigveda praises him for the same deed  Pargiter ach iuces considerable etidence to show that the true Brahman families were of pre Rigvedic origin ai id that the Aryan Icings of Madhyadesha were their o wn priests and in the eailiest times had no Brahmans  Strabo remarks that it is lecorded that ” “ The Indians worshipped Zeus Ombrios  the river Ganges and the indigenous gods  tous eyyojpioc  Satpo  a9 XV  718  and as Zeus Ombrios is clearly Indra  the thunder god  the sugge stion that the other gods worshipped are of indigenous origin is probably very near to the truth and the traditional view that the Hindu religion is a growth encirely subsequent to the Rigveda  or rather to the Rigvedic invasions  is no longer tonal  le  Rai Bahadur Raniaprasad Chanda in a paper on Non vedic elements in Brahmanism ” has made a number of points which the indicate the continued existence of the pre Rigvedic religions alongside of or in opposition to the orthodox Hinduism of the Brahmarshidesha  Quoting Kumarila and IMedhatithi he points out that the Smartas include non Vedic elements thus of the four orders named in the Dharmmitra of Gautama  Student  Householder  Ascetic and Heimit  only that of householder  grihastka  is prescribed in the Vedas that the Upanishads were not originally recognised as part of the Vedic canon at all and had their origin outside Vedic Hinduism that the Yatis destroyed by Indra are probably the forerunners of the Yatis of the Upanishads and the Smritis and that the latter order vrere organised on a pre Vedic model that the Pancharatra and Pasupata systems were condemned by Kumarila as non Vedic and that the   ai shnavite and fiiaivite sects are derived respectively from those two systems tliat contact with Pasupatas  Saivas  Jainas  etc   involved purification that by the time of the Mahabharata  however  Pancharatra and Pasupata are placed on a footing of recognised and orthodox religious authority  His general conclusion is that the cults of ^ ishnn  Shiva and Sakti originated among a people of different ethnic origins from the nhdlandic Aryans The point to be emphasised here is not so much c handa’s precise conclusions as the evidence he adduces of the smwival of pre Yedic religion alongside and inside the later forms of Hinduism  and of their gradual ahsorption and accepianceas a recogniscl part ot it  w l  ch has perhaps since dec eloped imo the poshion of their forming th^ most importa d piirt ‘                         of  it   If the view he accepted that the Hindu religion has its origin in nro Vedic times an i that in its later form it is the result of the reac  ion l v the reli rion of the country tc tho intrusive beliefs of the northern invaders  many fea uresof Hiivhr sm will become at once more comprehen sible  while the very  striking difference 3 etween the religion of the Rigveda and that of the Dharmashastras will seem natirvd  Ib will  however  be still necessary to look westward for the source of Hindu reli tion  though its spread in India was possibly in the nature of a peaceful infiltration along the trade routes from Asia iVIinor of beliefs and practices which associated themselves with those already followed by the indigenous inhabitants  This will i  \fSULAGAVA   397  explain Hinduism’s amalgamation with and absorption of local cults and its excessive entire accordance with the manner in which it still spreads at the present day  absorbing tribal religions in virtue of its social prestige and by identification of local gods with its own   by an experimental resort to Hindu priests  and b   the social promotion of pagan chiefs who  are provided with suitable mythological pedigrees  Onto the eaily Hindu beliefs spread in this manner the religion of the Eigveda has been imposed  and absorbed  Features survive curiously in out of the waj^ parts beyond the pale of Hinduism itself  Thus the horse sacrifice has become a fertility rite among the non Hindu Oaros of the Assam hills and appears likevuse in the wilds of Sumatra  though it has failed to establish itself in orthodox Hinduism  Similarly  though the sacrifice of cattle is anathema to the true Hindu  the Taittiriya Brahnana lecommended a whole series of animal slaughterings  including both bulls and cows  to be performed at the Panchasaradiya Sava and at the Asvatnedha  a series extremely suggestive of the scales laid down for successive feasts for the acquirement of social merit at such ceremonies as the Terhengi of the Angami Nagas  while the Grihya Sutra enjoins the Sulagava  “spitted cow” ceremony  corre sponding roughly to the Angami Sekrengi  as the Panchasaradiya does to the Terhencji  at which the beast was killed  as to day by Serna Nagas  with a pointed stake  and its death accompanied by the erection of a wooden post with a round top mortised on to it and by the distribution of the animal’s flesh  miiltiformity  and is moreover in  Viewed in this light it is not difficult to understand the claim of certRin politicians that the term Hinduism should cover all religions having their origin in India  even though we hold that the original impulse came from the ^Mediterranean or Asia Minor  since Jainism  Buddhism and  Sikhism are all offshoots of the same root  The claim is less logical when applied to tribal religions which ha  c not yet reached the stage of accepting Brahmans as priests or of attaching any sanctity to the cow or of worshipping in Hindu temples in their own   illages  An occasional visit to Hindu temples away from home is not quite a safe test since many such shrines undoubtedly occupy sites dedicated originally to more ancient indigenous deities and subsequently Hinduised  and in any case it is typical of primitive religions to propitiate the gods of any locality they may visit  Admittedly however the line is hard to draw between Hinduism and tribal religions  The inclusion of the latter within the Hindu fold is easy and wherever hill or forest tribes live in permanent daily contact with Hindus their religion rapid   assimilates itself to that of their neighbours though the old method of thinking is unchanged  Thus it is that religious or quasi religious beliefs and practices among Hindus appear very frequently to be based on the principles of magic  mana or other ideas common in The very word brahma itself seems to have probably connoted primitive religion  originally supernatural power or influence of the nature of mana a view apparently supported by the Atharv^a Veda  and these beliefs and practices survive and operate with all their primitive qualities alongside the loftiest heights of asceticism and philosophy  If it appears that the latter aspect of the Hindu religion is lost sight of in these pages  it is because their purpose is rather to articulate the fragments of the more primitive and material philosophy that preceded it  than to emphasise what is already of long standing and undisputed recognition      We may therefore expect to find very ancient and primitive beliefs continuing The sanctity of the fig tree for instance is possibly to be associated with the behefs of the Negrito inhabitants who appear to have formed the earhest population of India  It is probably on account of its milkhke sap that the ficus is associated with fertihty cults in Africa  Italy and New Guinea as well as in Assam and in southern India  and it is generally also connected with the spirits of the dead  This cult appears to be shared by the Andamanese under the guise of Hinduism   who are an approximately pure Negrito race and perhaps the only race still surviving At any rate they and their behefs  in the world comparatively unmixed in blood   have probably been isolated for some five thousand years at least  Similarly  though the probabihty is that this element of Hinduism is due to some pre Aryan immigrant cult from the direction of Asia Minor  the possibihty that some tribal and totemic taboo has acted as a contributory factor in the rehgious sanctity attaching Thus the flesh of cattle is tabooed by to cattle cannot be entirely overlooked  certain clans among primitive tribes of Assam and Indonesia who do not appear to have come even remotely under the influence of Hinduism  while on the other hand  \f     CHAPTER XI   398   RELIGION   the COW is regarded as completely tabooed by the Shins of Chilas  who are described byLeitner as a Hindu tribe with nowadays a veneer of Islam  the highest caste in Dardistan and really Brahmans themselves though expelled from India or from Kash mir by Brahmans  Not only do they taboo the flesh of the cow but also its milk and only touch a calf at the end of a prong  Pargiter’s view of the original conception of htahma as akin to that of mana has already been mentioned and this  sdew seems naturally to associate itself with the views on soul matter  or life itself as a transferable and material substance  which are so familiar in Indonesia and further India but which are actually common  enough in India itself   It is on this theory of the indestructibility and transfer   abihty of hfe matter that the underlying principle of head hunting is based in Assam in other parts of the same cultural area it is manifest in human sacrifice or in  cannibahsm  the latter perhaps bemg its most primitive manifestation and the former That the principle is still strong in India may be inferred its most developed  from a number of recent instances several of which are given later  In the form of head hunting this theory involves that which regards the head as the particular seat of the soul  and this behef is apparent in India proper in the sanctity which attaches to the head or to the hair  as also in many cases where the  soul impregnated   hair does duty for the individual  as in the case of the Naga who dies far from home and a portion of whose hair is brought back by his companions to be attached to the head of the wooden effigy which is then the subject of the usual funeral ceremonies  and as also in the case of the head hunter who so often substitutes the hair of his dead or even of his hving  and unwitting  victim for the head he cannot carry ofi   The Ujh Minas when unsuccessful in clacoity will only shave at home and Probably they fear that they may be sufiering after propitiating their goddess  from a loss of life essence as Samson did when his hair was cut  Conversely a Korku woman of the Central Provinces tries to obtain as a cure for baixenness a hair from the mother of a large family which she buries under her bathing stone  The same theory may perhaps be the origin of the familiar caste mark placed in The Angami Naga tribe regards front of the forehead just between eyebrows  this particular place as the special seat of the soul  conceived of as a diminutive human shape  which it is necessary to guard from the infectious influence of strangers by means of disinfectants  This is done by attaching to that particular spot on the forehead a small fragment of the leaf of the wormwood ^an effective disinfectant of spiritual influences  like other aromatic plants  It seems likely that it is in a practice of this sort and as a protection against danger to the soul that the use of the caste mark may have first originated      Fertility cults  have already been mentioned   These like head hunting and  human sacrifice are intimately associated with agriculture and the hne is hard to draw at the point at which a purely magical fertihty rite begins to develop into ceremonial of a genuinely rehgious nature  At any rate a point is easily reached by the former which is correlated to the latter  and the tribal cult ceases to be purely tribal and is identified with some definitely rehgious festival so that the magical  ceremonial and devotional aspects become merged  Magical fertihty rites  regarded as necessary to ensure the processes of nature  are thus conserved and crystallized and continue to be accepted as a natural feature in the ceremony when the reason of their being there is forgotten  So too features of the begimiing are natural and inevitable  since they are such rites which regarded as essentially necessary to make the rite effective  and for this reason are performed without any sense of impropriety or obscenity  become  when they cease to be essential to the ceremony  effectively indecent but are not recognised as such as long as the traditional form of the ceremony continues to be unquestioned  In this form ceremonies and practices survive long after the conditions of society in which they originated have changed  Thus rites essentially priapic survived at Isernia near Naples at any rate into the 19th century actually under the aegis of the Church  and it is only on contact with and under criticism from some external source that familiar and therefore unquestioned practices are seen in a new and critical light  That this process is now taking place in Hindu society is The Cochin  Government has prohibited the singing of sufficiently obvious  originally  m    Cf  also supra para  102   \fFERTILITY CULTS   399  obscene songs  etc   at the Holi festival  and advanced Hindu opinion would probably welcome a similar prohibition in many parts of British India  where already the festival seems to be generally celebrated with less excess than used to be the case  The Government of Mysore has abohshed the institution of Devad isis  and here again an influential element in Hindu society is loud in its approval  It is perhaps symptomatic of the tendency to reform and to even more drastic change in Hinduism that it should prove possible  as apparently it has in Bombay  to constitute an “ Anti Priestcraft Association ”  the professed purpose of which is “ to combat all rehgious and social beliefs and customs and institutions which cannot stand the test of reason ”  and members of which are reported to entertain a frankly bolshevist attitude towards all reUgidns and to advocate the destruction of all temples  churches and mosques  On the other hand httle efiective has been accomphshed in the way of removing untouchabihty in its real sense  It is often said that the  conditions of modern life have broken down the idea that contact with certain castes involves pollution  and this is true just to that extent to which  the use of conveniences such as trams  ’buses and trains necessitates a relaxation of the rule that certain castes pollute by touch and still more that they can pollute by mere proximity  Further there is a tendency obviously consequent on the necessity of relaxation referred to above to relax the rule of pollution by touch in the case of members of untouchable castes who do not pursue untouchable This does not necessarily involve any real abandonment of the avocations  attitude of caste Hindus to what the Census Superintendent of Assam conveniently The water they touch is still imdrinkable  describes as the “ Exterior Castes ”  food they touch becomes impure and they are not admitted to places of worship Indeed the most that or to restaurants nor will the ordinary barbers serve them  seems to have been yet accomplished  is the occasional staging of inter caste meals  gestures which appear so far to have had little practical effect on the general attitude But it must not be forgotten that the attempts of the caste to the outcaste Hindu  of the depressed classes to obtain the right of entry to temples is perhaps sometimes as much inspired by social motives as by religious ones  and produces an antagonistic reaction which might be absent if religion alone were involved   The tribal rehgions  as has been indicated already  represent  as it were  surplus material not yet built into the temple of Hinduism  How  similar this surplus is to the material already used will appear in many w’ays and may be noticed  to The Hindu rites of the shradh provide for the start wdth  in the cults of the dead  creation of a new body to house the soul of the deceased and  though theoretically renewed every year to maintain it  they are usually as a matter of fact gradually abandoned with the lapse of time  In the tribal rehgions this cult of the dead is seen in a precisely parallel form but at a very much more matter of fact and materiahstic stage of the development of the idea  Thus in Mysore the Hasalar tribe redeem the soul with a pig from the magician wbo has caused the death and domicile The Xicobarese and some it in a pot where it is supplied whth food and water  Naga tribes fashion wooden figures on wbich the skull of the deceased is placed in It is for a time order that the soul may leave it and enter the wooden figure  kept supphed with all w orldly necessities  A similar practice must formerly have obtained among the Garos of As sam  but it has disappeared and in the w ooden figures now used the peg s that held the skull in place have become unrecognizable  surviving apparently as a sort of a pair of ornamental horns  though an obsolete grave figure in the Indian Museum in Calcutta has a pair of horns much more  nearly approximating to the tran s frontier Konyak Naga type  Further west and south the Sawara of the Ganjam Agency tracts uses a similar but more conventionalised w^ooden figure to accommodate the soul of his cremated dead during the interval between death and cremation and the time for the erection of a stone or stones for the souls of the dead during the year past  which is done annually about the time of the sowung of the crop  Still further west the Kunbi of the Central Provinces make an image of their dead in brass w’hich is kept until the   This w’as

seen the chattries of deceased Hindu Maratha rulers in which the recumbent bull and a lingam face the waxen images of the dead prince and liis wife  which latter are piously supplied with food and other requisites and are entertained with music and have their clothes changed regularly once a week  In the very south of India the Malayarayans of Travancore make a metal effigy of the dead  which is kept in a miniature stone cist covered with a capstone  like the tattoed skull of a Konyak Naga in the north east  and erected on high ground  The image is brought out annually and feasted and worshipped with tulsi leaves on its head  Allusion  has already been made to the theory of soul matter as a fertilizer of the crops and a producer of life generally  a theory which appears to j crvade the magico religious thought and practice throughout Indonesia and south west Asia and survives in strength in further India  The Sawara custom above is probably a mere manifestation of the same idea  since the collective disposal of the village’s dead at the time of sowing is clearly associated in some Nasa tribes with thenaspect as crop fertilizers  while the Oraons of Chota Nagpur again tem  orarily inter their dead  if the paddy ha s sprouted  to be cremated the following year before it sprouts  The connection between the souls of the dead and the fertilization of the ground is reflected again in their very frequent association with water  It is hardly necessary to call to mind the value set by Hindus upon the immersion of their dead in the Ganges  but there are a number of parallel beliefs in more or less primitive tribes which do not  seem to owe their existence to Hindu influence but rather to share their origin with the ingredients of that religious system  Thus the Meithei practice of disposing of the frontal bone of the deceased in the Ganges appears  at first sight  to be the residt of their Hinduization  and no doubt their choice of the Ganges is such a result  but their neighbours the Kacharis  when yet unhinduized  used to consign their frontal bone to the Kopili river after the harvest  while the Rengma Naga makes a pool for water at the grave of any notable man that the rain  and rice  may be plentifid  and at least one other Naga tribe pours water on a grave to cause rain  while the Palaungs of eastern Burma fetch a bier pole from a grave and put it in a stream for the same purpose  The Santal again have the practice  at any rate under certain circumstances  of con signing a piece of bone from the head and another from the breast of the dead to the waters of the Damodar river  The Panwar mourner  besides throwing into the Narbada the   See above on page 398  and for an instance of such a specific theory page 409  below   M22CC  2d2  \fCHAPTER XI  RELIGION   402  bones of the dead  throws in with them some of his own hair also  thus perhaps vicariously accompamdng the soul  The Ivunbi practice of consigning to the Ganges the brass images of his ancestors has already been mentioned and the Bishnoi Brahmans of Sind were described by Tod as burying their dead at the ir thresholds and raising over them small altars on which they place an image Though nothing of Shiva a lingam  and a jar of water  Rajasthan  Till  ii   is said of any fertilizing effect these various practices would seem not unconnected  It is even possible that there may be some similar association with the dead or their avenging spirits in the crdeal by water described by Warren Hastings as practised by Hindus in the Ganges  the accused man submerging himself and holding to the foot of a Brahman  a form of ordeal parallels to which are practised by a number of primitive tribes from Western India to Vizagapatam and from the Central Provinces via Assam and Burma to Indo China  Even in the Eigveda itself there seems to be some notion of the souls of the dead as departing to the waters or vegetation  in spite of the more definite and prevaihng idea of a house of the dead  and in the later Vedic rite of garbhadha^ia to promote conception the husband infused grass in water and then poured the water down his wife’s nostril  which looks as though it were intended that soul matter from the grass should   i  enter the woman to cause her to conceive   The idea of soul matter as a fertilizing agent is probably also responsible for distinctive treatment of the bodies of those who die by “ bad ” deaths and are  therefore probably either unfertile or unsuitable or likely to lead to the reproduction It is thus that we find everywhere special treatment accorded to of bad results   the bodies of women who die in child biith  while other for m s of death are treated differently  i e   as bad or otherwise  by different tribes  In the case of persons killed by wild beasts the idea is perhaps the soul stuff of the dead is absorbed by the wild animal  and this is illustrated by the widespread behef that the soul of the dead rides on the tiger  as told for instance by the Annamites of Cambodia and the Baigas of Central India  The idea that the soul of a person killed enters the killer is found elsewhere  e g   in Australia   The same doctrine of soul matter is probably the principle which underlies head huntmg  human sacrifice and cannibalism  The first of these has been recognised in India only in Kafiristan and in Assam  though it is reported of the Bhils that they were at one time accustomed to bring back the heads of their enemies and hang them up in trees  Rajputana Census Report  1931   while the Kondhs circulated a head  hair and fingers as a signal for a rising in 1882  and of four heads taken in that rising one at any rate was “ affixed as a trophy ” to a tamarind tree near Billat village again a Brahui clan explain their name of Sarparra as meaning decapitator and have been identified with Strabo’s “ Saraparae  that is Decapitators ” who lived near the Guranii and the Medes and were “ savage intractable mountainy men ” who “ slash round the legs  and cut off the heads of strangers ” The theory however on which it is based  that the soul matter is specially located in the head  may be detected elsewhere  Thus the Andamanese attach special importance to the jawt and to the skull in mourning  and at any rate one case is recorded of their carrying off the cranium of a victim killed in warfare  The Newars of Nepal apparently show traces of the separate treatment of the head in burial  a feature frequently associated with head hunting in Assam  Indonesia and Oceania  Melanesia in particular  and undoubtedly based on the same idea  Head hunting as a ’  ‘       The generally preferred reading  7repKT tu6»t TTd   for Trepto ^eXio rd  is translated “ scalp in the Scythian manner ” but this is hardly compatible with decapitation  either would seem to be a ira^ Xeyo Mevov and the former reading is much more likely the emendation of a scholiast who knew his Herodotus  but was as unacquainted with what is a common feature of head hunting practice as with the unusual word coined by Strabo to describe it Casaubon indeed explains the name of the tribe as a facetious metaphor from Persian trousers  aapd^apa jodhpurs’  diminishing A Naga headhunter who does not actually remove and suspend from the village at the knee ’ head tree the foot and leg of his victim will frequently slash the legs in order to entitle him to wear the embroidered gaiters of a warrior wAo has taken his enemy’s legs  while some tribes on the north bank of the Brahmaputra are reported to cut off the hands and feet of their enemies  though they do not decapitate  probably to hamper possible attempts of the ghost to pursue ° ^ and harm them        ‘  ‘  t A  B   Special importance often attaches to the lower jaw among head hunters both in Asia and Africa and sometimes to the tongue which is regarded as the seat of life  \fHEADHUNTING   403  necessary preliminary to marriage  as it is in most if not all genuine head hunting tribes  is to be explained by the idea that unless a man has taken heads he has no surplus soul matter about him to beget offspring   Probably the same notion is to be seen in the Chang Naga practice of naming a child after a village raided by his father  Thus the present chief ofYongemdiis named Longkhong and his brother Ongli after the Ao villages Lungkhung and Ungr which were successfully raided by their father with considerable slaughter about the time that they came respectivelv into this world  The same notion is clearly present in the cases that come to light from time to time in India of murder as a remedy for barrenness in women  Thus in October 1929 the High Court of the Punjab had to deal with a case in which a girl  desperately anxious to bear her husband a son  killed a child  cut off its hands and feet and bathed herself standing upon them  It cannot be doubted but that the idea was that the life of the dead child should become the life of a fresh child in her womb  Again early in 1930 a case occurred in Oujarat of the murder by means of sulphuric acid of a 12 months old boy by a girl of 20 who had no child  and it was part of the prosecution case that it was a comparatively common practice on the part of barren women to attempt to quicken themselves by burning marks on children in the street  a practice no doubt ultimately derived from one which involved the taking of the child’s life  and which may be compared with that of branding children offered to the Syrian Goddess referred to below  page 411   And if head hunting is rare in India  human sacrifice  on the other hand  has been widespread and has clearly been ultimately based on the same conception of the necessitv or at any rate the desirability of releasing soul matter to fertilize  the earth  Xo doubt it was later interpreted as the placation or propitiation of an earth deity  but this must be regarded as a sophisticated justification of a practice the true meanmg of which had become obscure or been forgotten  The Kondhs are described as havhig performed their Meriah sacrifices to the earth mother  but the details of the ceremonv and the practice of distributing fragments of the sacrificial meat in their fields and granaries show a very patent connection with the disposal of enemy flesh by headhunting hfagas and the underlying idea is undoubtedly the same  In one form of the sacrifice the victim was squeezed to death in a cleft in a green tree  and in another the tears caused by his sufferings brought rain in proportion to their profusion  Similarly the of Burma definitely associate their head hunting with the sowing of the crop  while the successful Kafir head hunter was greeted  on his return from the foray with his trophy  by a shower of grain  In Kulu the transplanting of the rice is accompanied by the sacrifice of a rough dough image of a man to the house god  So again the Dasehra festival  now associated by all Hindus with the killing of Havana by Rama  coincides throughout most of India with the sowing of the winter crops  in particular with that of millet  a more ancient staple in south Asia than rice  as well as with that of wheat  It is this festival that is associated in western India with the worship of weapons of war  and it is still regarded there as a proper day on which to go forth and loot  while it is then that human sacrifices used to be performed in eastern India  and it is still on this festival that the gwpta puja  the hidden rite  to ensure the prosperity of the person  house or family  would be resorted to if ever  The association of human sacrifice with the prosperity of the individual and with the success of the state in war seems clear enough  and its association with crops may be inferred with equal safety  It was probably some such association of soul substance with fertility and perhaps with some notion of a higher fertility value attaching to Europeans that led Oraons to remove portions of the body of a recently buried European not very long ago  The e  idence at the trial made it clear that special value attached to European bones for magical purposes The location of the soul in the head and the  see Indian Antiquary  Dec  1929   confusion of the soul with the shadow are illustrated in the Himalayan cure for fever in which the patient stands in the sun and a bone filled with grain is buried in the spot where the head of the shadow falls  Crooke  Religion and Folklore of N  India  1926  page 222   The same idea of soul matter as a fertiliser is probably at the bottom of human sacrifice as a cure for illness  as in the case of a Santal of Dhanbad who in 1931 garlanded and then beheaded his infant son in order to effect a cure of his own maladies    Conversely 1 have known a  Brahman gardener in the Simla Hills refrain from setting  grafts himself since to do so would prejudice his chance of begetting children  clearly on account of the loss of life matter instead he called in an old man past the breeding age to do it for him     M22CC  b2  \fCHAPTER XI   404   ^RELIGION   True caruiibalism is only traditional in India but vestiges of ceremonial cannibalism survive in many places or have done until recently  Thus Portman records the practice of Andamanese homicides  who drank of the blood and ate of the raw fat of the victim and of the flesh of his breast  the latter apparently cooked  In the north west the Kafirs used to eat a piece of the heart and drink some of the blood of their enemies they killed  In the north east the Lushei of Assam used to taste the liver and lick from the spear head the blood of the first victim slain in war  The nearly related Thado eats his first meal after taking life with hands deliberately imbued with his enemy’s blood and still uncleansed therefrom  a custom practised as late as 1919  and the same custom obtains in a decayed form among the independent Sernas of the Assam frontier  where a returning head  taker must eat at least a morsel of food before entering his village the insistence is on the meal now  but it is eaten with still ensanguined fingers as he may not cleanse himself until after he has taken this meal     The intention in all these cases is certainly to transfer to the slayer the soul matter or life matter of the slain  just as the soul matter of so many kings has been transferred to their successors by their murder  Similar in principle is the practice of anointing at his succession the intrusive Rajput ruler with the blood of the indigenous Bhil who regards the right to give it as a precious privilege  even though the giver is believed always to die within the year  his soul matter exhausted no doubt in pro ’idiag for the fertility and prosperity of the State  It was no doubt a similar idea to that of the Kafir and the Thado which inspired the action of Nana Pharari  a notorious dacoit of Nasik in Bombay Presidency who stabbed a personal enemy in July 1930  pulled out his knife from the victim and applied its gory blade to his forehead and to his tongue  The action of applying the blood to the forehead oSers a very close parallel to that of the Angami Naga who never drinks liquor without applying on the tips of his finger a drop to his forehead for the benefit of the material soul resident within  The drinking of human blood and the tasting of human flesh is common in Indonesia and Oceania and it is likely that it has at one time been more prevalent It was reported of the in India than it is now  of Burma by Sir George Scott that probably human flesh was eaten on special occasions  possibly at the harvest festival  the a are also credited by the Shans with eating their dead relatives like the Battak of Sumatra  and this  a practice probably arising rather from a belief in reincarnation than directly from that in life or soul matter  has also been reported of some tribes in India  thus Herodotus mentions the Callatians as an Indian tribe known by Darius to practise this  and he attributes the same custom to the Padaei  for whom an identification has been suggested Avith the Birhor of Chota Nagpur whom Dalton states to have admitted its former pratice by their tribes  The same custom has been likewise attributed to the Lobas of north east Assam  called Mishu Ting Ba by the Tibetans  in particular  to the hill tribes of Chhattisgarh and of the Amarkantak tableland  as to the hill tribes of Assam  in general  and to some of the transfrontier Kachins of north west Burma  though in these cases there is no well authenticated evidence  possible survival of the same practice is to be found in the Kharia custom in the Central Provinces of catching  and eating communally  a fish on the third day after a person’s death  the fish being a common vehicle of the soul as is noted elsewhere in this chapter  All this points to some pre existence of this practice and to a clear cultural link between the more primitive tribes of India and those of the Indian archipelago   Wa  W  A  Perhaps the crudest form in which the doctrine of soul substance appears is the vulgar but Avidely credited superstition AA hich attributes to the European the practice of catching fat black boys and hangmg them by the heels over a slow fire to distil from a puncture in the skull the seven drops of vital essence which imparts to sahibs in general their energy in field sports and their activity of mind and body  Curiously enough this life essence  this nmniyai  seems to have started as bitumen simply and to have been used as a quite legitimate medicine  then to have become a spurious substitute in the form of resin  the supposed virtues of which were later attributed by confusion to the embalmed bodies from which this resin was most readily obtained  From the dead body a fourth transfer has taken place and superstition now imputes the virtue of the medicine to its distillation from the fi ving body in the form of its fife essence  This belief caused several harmless strangers to be beaten in Saharanpur recently on the suspicion that they were manufacturers of this elixir  Enthoven mentions that it gave some trouble in the outbreak of plague in 1896 in Bombay  and the belief is clearly still active  Possibly it  \f405  momiyai   has some bearing on the reluctance felt in India to remain in a hos 3ital  Here again it is by Hindus  or persons classified as such  that this superstition is generally held  and the Kabuli trader who brings momiyai for sale from Afghanistan is probably under no delusion as to its composition or virtue  The theory is also to be seen in the Aghonpanth philosophy  Russell  Tribes and Castes of the C  P   Vol  II  and in occasional cases of cannibalism that come to light in the criminal courts  Thus in September 1931 two men  one apparently a Rarhi Brahman ascetic and the other a Mahabrahman were accused in Bankura of having dug up the newly buried corpse of a child  of having taken it to their asrani and of having there cooked and eaten part of it the Rarhi Brahman admitted hamng eaten a little of the heart “ as he believed it was a part of his rehgion to do so ”  It is perhaps partly due to the influence of the primitive belief in this life giving soul matter that so much importance is attached in India to the reproduction of the species to pass it on reduplicated to the next generation  so that the penalty of failure to marry is among the more primitive tribes extinction at the hands of a demon who bars the pathway of the dead  while among a number of Hindu castes  as also among the Todas of southern India  the corpse of a person dymg unmarried is married before cremation as a neces   sary qualification to future happiness  The doctrine of soul substance as a fertiUser is naturally not less applicable to animals than to human beings  and it is therefore not surprising to find the Malas of southern India and Ahirs at the Gaidaur festival causing their cattle the young in particular to trample a pig to death  after which according to the ancient custom  the corpse of the pig is eaten by the Ahirs who thus share in the transfer of the porcine fife substance to their cattle  In the case of the Koravas  who have a similar practice  an instance of the substitution of a human being for the more usual pig is actually on record

belief in soul matter probably is the practice of erecting megahthic monuments and wooden images of the dead  The two practices are not completely separable as both appear primarily to be intended to afford a temporary dwelling for the soul pending its operation as a fertilizer of the crop  The megalithic monument appears very often as merely a permanent substitute for the impermanent wooden statue which can be given greater resemblance to the human body  Thus the wooden statues of the dead put up by the Angami Nagas of Assam are in some villages destroyed after the harvest and the others have a small stone erected behind them to do duty when they have perished  In other villages again a man’s youngest son succeeding to his father’s house must put up a monolith for his deceased parents  an act corresponding to that of some other ^ullages in which the monoliths are erceted during their lifetime by specially prosperous persons to enhance the prosperity of the community as a whole  The significance of the latter monolith is quite definitely phallic and ancient specimens still exist whose form puts this beyond dispute  both as a solid menhir and as hollow monohths which contained the ashes of the dead  and there is no doubt but the association is here again with the soul matter as a fertility agent  and an echo of the doctrine is perhaps to be foimd in the Vijayanagara legend of

associated with menhirs and dolmens and other symbols of fertiht   hke the milky ficus or euphorbia trees  The remains of this megahthic culture in India are widespread though in most places completely decadent  and they generally show sporadicaUy very similar traits  Thus the disposal of the dead of the community during the sovdng season has already been mentioned and in further India it is   or used to be  associated with a certain amount of mummification of the dead to make them keep  some tribes  e g   the Ao Kagas smoke drying the body  others e g   the Khasis  embalming it in honey  The use of a soul figure is merely a different method of obtaining the same end  and by the Konyak Naga of Assam a wooden figure is provided to house the soul until the head can be separated and disposed of in a phallic stone cist  The Sawara of the Ganjam Agency in Madras burn their dead  but a wooden figure is provided to house the soul till the erection of monoliths for the dead which takes places annually about Soul figures  probably of similar purpose in the first instance  the time of sowing  The Kicobarese  hke some Nagas  are made in earth by the Handi Jogi of Mysore  place

treasured headgear of the dead man  It is impossible not to see the same idea underlying the waxen figures of deceased Hindu princes already referred to accompanied as they are by a stone lingam  It seems therefore not unlikely that the carved stones erected to the memory of Rajput dead of both sexes have a similar origin  and table stones may seen in Rajputana erected to mark the site of a Sati  occasionally be that the dolmen is used as a memorial of the dead by fact recalling the Chota Nagpur  while by some A ssam tribes the upright monolith and Munda of the recumbent dolmen are used to correspond respectively to the male and to the female sexes  A reference to Volume IX of the Bombay Gazetteer definitely confirms the supposition that the Rajput memorial stone has the same origin as the Naga or Khasi menhir  Unhewn stones  hhntra  or carved stones are raised  we learn  by most cla sses of Hindus in Gujarat for deceased persons    ometimes for all  but    more particularly for those that have died a violent death    or been remarkable   Tla   Census Superintendent of Madras may he conveniently tpioted practices in South India “ Pudaws or sluines exist to which no priests or

directed rather towards shrines and saints than towards deities ”  \fMONOLITHS   407  for tteir holiness    These stones are sometimes placed in a shrine  sometimes under a pipal tree  Until the shrine is set up the spirit of the deceased is dangerous  We may perhaps infer that the reason why such stones are set up  particularly for persons whose spirits are likely to he dangerous  is in order to appease them by providing an abiding place for them and so conforming to an ancient custom otherwise liable to be foregone  The carved stones take the ordinary form of a Rajputana or Kathiawar memorial stone or may be replaced by “ a bust of black marble  brick or wood ” but it is significant that they are worshipped by the newly married  or by a bridegroom on the way to fetch the bride  recalhng the ceremony performed by childless Konyak Kagas on their phallic stone skull cists  and the practice of barren women to strip themselves at dawn and embrace naked the stone slab

  \fCHAPTER XI   408    RELIGION   The Nagas  like the people of Xias in tbe Indian archipelago  transport megaliths on wooden sledges made from the forked trunk of a tree which are dragged by very large numbers of men pulling on cane or creeper ropes  In the case of the Xaga at any rate an essential implication of the ceremony is the infection of the village with the prosperity of the celebrant  and when the ceremony i s performed with wooden instead of stone emblems these end herns are formally dragged all round the village with this express purpose  Very suggestive of a degenerate form of this ceremony is the village festival  ghasbavji  in Rajputana at which the ’ygod   consisting of a large waterworn boulder  is dragged round the village on a sled made out of a forked tree trunk  Probably of sinnlar origin also  s the general veneration paid to stones throughout India  parricularlv of course to those of queer or unusual shape  Crooke  in The Religion and Folldore of Northern India  gives a very large ^umber of examples which it is unnecessary to recapitulate  but it may be recorded here that a suit was argued in the Calcutta High Court on the 25th of April 1929 about a stone about 5 feet square  ajtparently of black slate or marble from Jaipui  which changed hands for Rs  10 000  £750  as being very efficacious in the matter of getting a son The suit arose because the  ^tone failed to function  and it was stated in evidence that numbers of even quite welheducated Hindus bebeved in the efficacy of stones of this kind when used with the correct rites  and that so much as a lakh might be paid for such It was abo mentioned that sitting on a stone is an essential feature in a  ^tone  many Jain rites   meaalitli s seams to have left traces in western India   It  may here be urged that the reverence and superstition paid to stones in  is not  as Crooke suggests  a vague supersitition which develops into the use of memorial stones hut on the contrary is the degenerated remnant of the lifeessence fertility cidt  The use of a stone or mere pebble as a pretyasila “ stone of the disembodied spirit ” by Hindus in western India seems a definite instance of this process of decay  The stone is picked up by the chief mom ner at the place where the corpse was put down and is anointed with oil  recalling the baetyls of Xaga fertility cults   a crow is induced to eat corn scattered about it and the pebble  general   then thrown into running water or kept among the household deities  Similarly the Komati caste of Mysore invokes the soul of the deceased to enter a pebble te  npi l a’ ily  while the ashes of th e deceased are cast into a sacred river or some other is  It seems  lier  fore much more likely that a veneration of stones on account water  nf the indwelling smd has l t  eii transferred to peculiar stones in general on account of similar possibilities  than that a vague reverence of stones should exist without  reason and be elaborated into a coherent creed which really turns on a belief in the power of soul matter to promote the fertility of nature  An extension of the same idea would seem to appear in the practice of requiring spirit or soul matter of the dead to impart permanence or  to use our own metaphor  “ life ” to buildings  This practice is referred to as that of foundation “ sacrifices but the idea of sacrifice  pres nt at all  is clearly later than the practice itself  which is essentially of the Sciine origin in India  wheT e at least a belief in the necessity survives  and in Oceania  where in hiji and in the Marquesas  for instance  human sacrifices were ie  un C  l t  iur est a building  r a canoe with the necessai y  mna  This belief is still so prevalent in India as to be the cause of a good deal of disturbance from time to time  In 1922 the Deputy C’ommissioner of Dibrugarh had to issue a notice reassuring people against 7nur katas    headcutters ”  coming to kill or behead male children for some unkown prupose and to threaten with prosecution anyone assisting In 1923  m the 27th May a riot took place on Cinnamara to spread the rumour  tea estate on account of a scai’e about the kidnapping of children for the foundation of a new bridge  In June 1924 a rumour in Calcutta that the Port Commissioners were seeking for chikben to bury in the fmmdation of the new Kidderpore dockyard led to Punjabi taxidrivers being killed in the belief that they were agents decoying children for this pmpose  and in the same month strangers in Patna were maltreated in connection with a similar scare about a bridge in Bihar  In 1926 in north Lakhimpur there was a rumour that arkas  i e   head takers    were trjdngto obtain children’s heads for the construction of a railway bridge  In the same year the district engineeer constructing the recent bridge on the Sibsagar Road Khowang Railway had trouble from a kidnapping scare  which was so much intensified when a retaining wall burst that schoolboys asked leave in order to stay at home for fear of being kidnapped on their way to school  Several petitions weie filed in the if  1  1  i  •  \f‘  FOUNDATION SACRIFICES  409  S  D  O ’s office  also against suspected kidaappers  while villagers insisted on visiting and counting tea garden coolies during the night in order to assure themselves that they were not concealing victims in

in the Burmah Oil Company s w’ells  A strange coolie was roughly bandied on the 12th of that month in Cachar and a stranger from Sylhet was beaten and confined on the same suspicion on the 10th  In January 1929 a rumour in Bombay that children were being kidnapped for the ccnstrucbion of a bridge in Baroda led to an attack on Pathans  and on a Creek engineer  to the death of a Hindu carpenter and ultimately during two days time to the killing of 17 Pathans wliile two other Muslims and three Hindus were killed in the consequent affrays  very many other persons being injured  In the subsequent riots 149 people were killed and the damage to property came to at least 5 lakhs of rupees  In May 1929  in Bihar again this time  a man was beaten to death in the belief that he wms seeking to kidnap a child as a foundation sacrifice ” for a bridge at Jamshedpur  w’hile the floods in the Surma valley of the same year led to a scare that children were being kidnapped for the reconstruction of certain embankments in the Manipm State   In certain tribes of the Naga Hills in Assam a live chicken is still placed in the hole dug for the main house post and the post stepped   U to it  w hile it is asserted that certain transfrontier tribes use a human being thus  as formerly in Fiji  “ to hold up the post ”  Phe same idea is to be seen in a practice attributed by Mr  S  N  Hoy   in Man in India  IX  page 272  to Bengali boat builders who have had to dispute their dues with a customer a few di’ops of the ship wright’s blood are plugged into a cavity in the planking  wffien the boat acquires a malevolent vitality  diowns its crew and continues an independent existence as an aquatic phantom  A sword used in sacrifice acquires a similar vitality from the blood of the victinis it decapitates  and like boats it is furnished with eyes painted in vermilion     been already indicated that the soul is often conceived in the tribal maniidn and being located in the head  and though this conception is apparently at conflict w^itb the theory of soul matter or a material life substance it is held concurrently with it without any consciousness of inconsistency  Ttiere is nothing remarkable in this  but the question arises whether these two conceptions are of different origin or may have come into being from the same source  and it is here submitted that the conception of the soul as a manikin is merely the effect  on a rather vague conception as to the natm’e of life  of that tendency towards anthropomorphism w hich is inevitable when man is to conceive of a material wfith some of his owm attributes and no known shape and which is apparent in the conception of the deity in the great majority of religions  The Karen of Burma have a doctrine of a material substance w bich is the cause of life  or rather which is actually life itself  a sort of ectoplasm of life  which leaves the dying body to enter the herbs of the field or the seeds of the earth  and w hich then passes through grass into cattle and through grain  or indirectly through the meat of grazing animals  into man and passes through the seminal fluid to generate fresh life  precisely as if it consisted of carbohydrates   This doctrine may perhaps be regarded as having arisen very early in the history of mankind as a natural result of speculation as to the cause of the change that takes place at death and as to the nature of that which has left the body  Speculation of some kind would be inevitable  if It has  religions of India as ha  mg the form of a  only as a result of the natural curiosity  required by any animal  human or otherwise  to adapt itself to environment in the struggle to survdve  Abstract ideas come late in the development of a language and presumably therefore late in the development of thought  and hence the necessity  before any philosophic idea of life can be framed  of regarding it as a material  substance and of thinking of that substance as taking some form  The idea then of a manikin living behind the forehead whose movements are registered on an infant’s fontanelle is a not unnatural symptom of the development  or degeneration  of the life substance theory and may perhaps be traced in that doctrine of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy which regards the soul as encased in a series of sheaths the interior of which accompany the soul on its migration while the exterior constitutes the material body and the location i    It seems certain that the strange provision in the Brahmanical code which makes the Telia an untouchable caste  but not the Tib  who only sells not presses oil  is due to their practice of  destroying the seed in the pursuit of their occupation without provision for its transfer to another living organism  a suggestion confirmed  I think  by Manu  iv  85   \fCHAPTER XI   410   RELIGION   of the soul in the head is illustrated by the Hindu belief that it escapes through the “ crevice of Brahma through which ascetics can project their soul  and so die  at will  while for less holy persons it is necessary to fracture the skull with a conch The salagrama held to the aperture perhaps served the shell to let out the soul  same purpose as the freiijasila mentioned above  One is also reminded of the story in the Aitareya Brahmana  vide Rajendralala Mitra  Indo Aryans  II  76  of how the gods killed a man for their sacrifice  but the part in him fit for an offering went out  leaving him deformed  and entered a horse  and so on throughan ox  which turned to a gayal when the fit part left it   a sheep and a goat and entered the earth  where the gods surroimded it so that no escape was possible  when it turned into rice  Father Schmidt considers that in India “ the materialistic Sankhyan philosophy most certainly arose from matrilineal animism ” and he suggests that the spiritual philosophies of classical Greece may have had at least in part a similar source  Having got as far as materializmg our life principle  its conception as similar in feature to that of the body is inescapable  and the way is clear The doctrine reached is logically irreconcilable for the doctrine of reincarnation  with the theory with which we started but experience shows that the two can be held simultaneously  at any rate b ^ primitive man  without any consciousness of inconsistency  There are probably  however  steps by the way which contribute to this belief ^the idea of the soul commg back as an insect is one  and one to which the conception of the soul as able to leave the body and flit about at night  derived in part no doubt if not entirely from the phenomena of dreams  has contributed  As instances the Lhota Hagas of Assam and the Kunbis of Bombay and the Kamis of Bengal may all be quoted as watching for an insect after a person’s death  or the Ahirs  Kamars and Gonds who go to a river and bring back an insect or a fish as contahiing the soul and sometimes  in the case of the Gonds at least  eat it to ensure its rebirth  Another contributory observation to the insect notion is perhaps the mysterious way in which large numbers of insects appear from nowhere in particular  as if caused by superfluity as it were of life substance  an idea w hich w ould have been comprehensible enough to the ancient world  which regarded for instance insect life as spontaneously engendered in dung dropped under a waxing moon  etc   vide Pliny  Nat  Hist    Bk  II   or which regarded the Nile floods as pouring soul into the sods so as to fashion live creatures from the ver   soil  Ntlus gkubis etiam infundat animus  e% ipsaque himo vifalia effingat Pomponius Mela  I  52   bringing us back again to that fertility cult which associates soul with water  Similarly Diodorus Siculus  I  i  says “ moisture generates creatures from heat  as from a seminal principle ” and a little further on “ they say that about Thebes in Egypt  after the overflowing of the river Nile  the earth thereby being covered with mud and slime  many places putrefy through the heat of the sun  and thence are bred multitudes of mice  It is certain  therefore  that out of the earth animals are generated ” These ideas of life in dung and water seem to have been combined in the practice which so disgusted the Abbe Dubois at the temple of Nanjanagud in Mysore some 150 years ago  Barren women and their husbands w ere described by him as drinking out of the temple sewer from hands soiled by setting aside a portion of the ordure to be examined a few days later w hether insects or vermin w^ere engendered in it  which w as regarded as “a favourable prognostic for the woman ”  The same belief probably accounts for the practice of throwdng dung at a bridal pair  a practice common for instance in the Assam Hills  W hatever be its origin  how ever  a vague belief in reincarnation is common to most of the tribal religions in India and is generally associated more or less wdth some degree of ancestor worship  a tendency to which is everywhere apparent  This reincarnation belief is to be seen very clearly in the ancient Brahmanic theoiy thad after the birth of a son the sexual relationship of husband and wife should cease  since the son is the father’s self and the father’s wife has beconie his mother also  It is stated of the Kochhar sub caste of the Khatn  a trading ca ste of the 1 uiijab  that a father s funeral rites are performed in the fifth month of his wife’s first pregnancy  which points to the same idea   The Bishnoi of Hissar bury  an infant at the threshold that its soul may re enter the mother and be born again  Among the Bhuiyas every child is regarded as a reincarnation of some deceased relative  while the Mikirs  it may be noticed  believe reincarnation except for the souls of those who have been killed by tubers  Among the Lushei the reincarnated soul sometimes appears as a hornet  sometimes as dew and in the latter form the belief is hardly distinguishable from the Karen theory           m  \fREINCARNATION   411  So again it is a common practice with the tribes mentioned that while a dead grandfather’s name or that of another ancestor must be given to a child  the name of a living ancestor shall not be given as either he or the new born child will die  The practice was perhaps similar in ancient Indian society as in old lists of kings it is common to find a grandson named after the grandfather  This practice seems  however  to have changed as the name of any ancestor living or dead is reported now to be avoided by Hindus  of life substance   The association of reincarnation  vith the sonl fertility cult is perhaps confirmed to some extent by Malcolm’s record of the practice of jumping oft certain high rocks in Central India in order to be re born in a royal house  Forsyth  Highlands of Central India  also records the account of an eyewitness  Captain Douglas  Political Assistant in Nimar  of a scene at Omkar  a shrine of Shiva on Mandhatta island in the Narbada  at which a young man leaped oft a rock 90 ft  high to his death in 1822  and mentions a later case of an old woman who hesitated and was pushed over  In the case of this rock apparently if the jumper survived  he was killed by a “ priestess ’’ with a dagger  but in the case of another of these rocks if a man survived the fall he was made Raja and the association between the soul and the fertility of the land impinges on that between the fertihty of the land and the king as the hving receptacle or embodiment of the life  spirit  and one which must not be allowed to grow old  One is reminded  however  by this habit of jumping oft a clift to royal incarnation of a number of similar practices associated in each case with the fertihty of the soil   Thus rope sliding  beduart  in the Himalayas would appear to be a definite survival of a similar form of voluntary The slider  an acrobat or dancer  6efZa  by caste  is or involuntary human sacrifice  in milk  dressed in new clothes  and carried round the as Mahadeo  bathed worshipped which ceremony  is resorted to when harvests have been bad  fields before the village That this is a survival of human sacrifice is clearly indicated by the fact that both the rope used and the hair of the slider are distributed as fertihty charms while the slider himself becomes infertile  for his fields go barren and the seed he sows He is in fact spiritually deadf and his hfe  matter has been fails to burgeon  distributed to his neighbours  We are recalled to the Kondh meriah whose parent was consoled by his neighbours in words which Macpherson has recorded    Your It is worth remarking that the child has died that all the world may live ”  hereditary caste of rope sliders is the Nat caste and that the women of that caste Both are are associated in many parts of India with dancing and prostitution  probably closely connected wfith fertility rites and it may be that the professions of tight rope walker  acrobat  dancer and prostitute take their origin in services performed primarily for the benefit of the crops  In former days it is said that the slider who fell off the rope was cut to pieces at the bottom  and the rite as a whole suggests a chastened form of human sacrifice in which it was essential that the victim should fall from a great height  It recalls insistently the ceremony described as practiced at the temple of the Syrian Goddess where from a very lofty porch between two gigantic phalli the animal or sometimes apparently human victims were hurled to the ground and where worshippers let their children dovm in a sack aft er branding them  c   sujyra p  403  as devoted to the deity  In the northeast corner of India the Angami Naga still hurls from the roof of a house his sacrificial victim  a puppy dog mvested with the symbolic attributes of a man  while a calf released below is hterally tom to pieces by the crowd  Meanwhile ashes representing clouds and cotton seeds representhig hail are thrown by the ’ priest from the roof  clearly showing that not only is a distribution of the victims fife essence involved but a fall of fertilizing  water probably intended to be magically ensured by a fall of the victim from above      One phenomenon of primitive religion which cannot be ignored when witing of India is totemism  traces of which are shown by primitive tribes in all parts of India and by not a few castes that have reached or retained a high social position   From the Bhils in the west to  the Wa of eastern Burma     from the    Tod  Annals  XI  ch  iv  says “ love of off spring ” is the motive  but he does not explain  and one is almost inclined to suspect him of facetiousness  t Like the Maithil Brahman mentioned by Wilson  hidian Caste  II  194   who was outcasted by his family because he recovered after his funeral  ceremonies had actually been performed in expectation of his decease  and like the Bhil referred to above  p  1  who dies within a year of the use of his blood to anoint his lord as king   \fCHAPTER XI   412    RELIGION   Kanets of the Simla hills to members of Telugu castes of southern India  clear traces of totemism are found to survive  and it is needless here to go into details already sufficiently well known and recorded  It may be enough to recall “ the Saurasthra    Jethwa Rajputs who claim descent from longtailed Ranas of Hanuman  and the ruler of the Malabar coast whose death involves abstention from fishing lest the soul inhabited fish be captured  to show that totemistic ideas are not entirely confined to primitive tribes and to castes low in the social Various theories have been put forward to account for totemism of which scale  the most satisfactory is Sir James Frazer’s “ conceptional ” theory  His position  put briefly  is that a period must have existed in human history when the function consequently the of the male in producing ofispring was as yet unrecognised of conception sought for a cause explain consciousness to the phenomenon female on animal plant  Clearly to some or we need not  attributed it indeed cannot  and of Austrahan existing beliefs the tribes  on the which Sir James that suppose bases his diagnosis  represent the belief in totem birth in its original form  and assuming that his theory is correct we may probably imagine conception as first attributed to something eaten  touched or even merely seen by the conceiving woman  Granting the coexistence of the soul matter theory of life and death and the inclusion in that theory of plants or fruit  it would be easy to speculate as to the source of the new life within the womb from soul matter taken in food  In any case ignorance of paternity can hardly have lasted for a very long period in most branches of the human race  and in the well known instance of the Trobriand    Islands Moubray  Matriarchy in the Malay Peninsula  p  53  has plausibly argued that the Trobrianders’ emphatic denial of the father’s share in procreation is the result of a decay of society starting from the point of development at which matriliny was about to swing over patriliny  Be that as it may  it is obvious that once the idea of totemism be started it would be kept alive and fed by ideas  and sentiments not adequate in themselves perhaps to start the theory  The urged as causes of totemism cannot psychological considerations sometimes be regarded as the actual causes since ideas must have some ultimate reference to observed experience  but they will contribute to the retention of an idea which would not otherwise survive  Frazer himself has pointed out the theory of the external soul as apparently responsible for some forms which  if not actually totemism  resemble it so closely as makes no matter and while it has been recently argued by an American anthropologist that totemism arises from food restrictions  others have traced it Bullock  Man  XXXI  185  regards to theories of the transmigration of soul  totemism as developing subsequently to exogamy and as being merely the machinery by wdiich exogamy is implemented  This conclusion is based on a study of the institutions of the Mashona  where  he says  “ the connection between totemism and exogamy is undoubted ”  This  however  does not prove that such a connection always existed  since no society is in a static condition and an accidental coincidence may easily develop into a coalescence  Durkheim with greater plausibility  L’annee sociologiqae  vol  i  regards totemism as the cause of a taboo on incest and consequently as the cause of exogamy  It is simplest  perhaps  to accept Frazer’s view of the origin of totemism and to regard the other explanations as having contributed to extend or support the belief after a period at which the observation of the fact of paternity would otherwise have put a natural end to it  If it so happened that exogamy originated at an early totemic period of the human race  it is natural to find it surviving where totemism survives either in some semblance of its earliest form as a conception theory or in a developed form into which other beliefs have entered  Such a view  of totemism also agrees wdth the extreme variety of its manifestations  ranging from the sacramental consumption of the totem or its use for magical augmentation of the food supply  to the merest peg for exogamy to hang upon  and it is in the latter form that it is commonest in India where it has generally decayed into a mere There are  however  traces of taboos and beliefs essential totemistic clan name  Some tribes with wffiat appear to be totemistic clan to it at an earlier stage  names no longer regard them as such  Thus the Thevoma clan of the Angami  of the Sema would appear in both cases to ISTagas and the Awmmi bear names translatable as “ Pigmen ”  but no such meaning is asrribed by the Angamis  who explain the name as a human patronymic  while the corresponding Sema    \fTOTEMISM   413  clan gives an adventitious explanation of an ancestor who was bitten by a pig on the other hand the Ao Naga neighbours of these tribes have a dog clan which still claims canine characteristics  e g   speed of foot and doglihe features  moreover they taboo the dog as food or rather used to taboo it until recently they found it desirable to break the taboo in order to benefit by the medicinal virtues of dog flesh  Another Ao clan again  the Wozakumr Hornbill people  claim descent from a woman who conceived as a result of a feather dropping in her lap from a hornbill flying overhead  and it is taboo for them to kill a hornbill or even to see a dead one  It may hkewise be noted that the Hindu Chasa of Orissa regard the injuring of their clan totem as punished by leprosy  a fate which the Brahman regards as caused by killing a cow           Into this conception theory of totemism the belief in fife  matter seems hardly to enter unless it be perhaps to the extent that the supply of totem soul is limited and is continually passing through death and rebirth from one member of the clan to another  This appears to be the case in Australia but it is not reported of any tribe in India  On the other hand the external soul  which seems to be a development of the life matter belief  does appear as connected with totemism in India much as it is in parts of Africa  As a possible source of the connection between totemism and the external soul the phenomena of birth may be suggested  The afterbirth is well known to be intimately associated with the idea of the external soul and is regarded in some cases as actually containing it  Thus among the Baganda it is buried under a plantain tree and a woman may conceive if pollinated  as it were  by the dropping on her of a plantain flower  In the case of the chief  however  the placenta is carefully preserved and brought to him to handle and return to safe keeping on state occasions  Here we are reminded of the placenta standard on the palette of Narmer  No doubt as the abode of the king’s vital essence the proximity of such a standard in time of danger would be useful and if the standard be the abode of the external soul we have the explanation both of the association of totems with standards and the apparent paradox of taking into danger a very highly prized emblem the capture of which is regarded by the enemy as of great significance t One may recall the Fairy Banner of the McLeods which not only brings victory but causes a cow to drop her calf or a pregnant woman to give birth on the sight of it  It may be inferred that its quickening property is due to its being the seat of external soul matter  J If the placenta be thus regarded as the location of the external soul  a possible origin of totemism at once suggests itself in the possibility of the placenta being devoured by some scavenging animal or bird or being associated with the tree on which it is placed for security or with some plant whi h springs up on the spot where it is buried  It is necessary of course to postulate a subsequent transfer of the totem from the individual to the exogamous ^lan d  scended from him or her  but such an origin would perhaps account for a purely social form of totemism in v hich there was no sacramental element and no magical food production  It would also account for a soul  transmigration form of totemism   onnection ro draw attention to the case of the plantain Baganda soul matter from a placenta at its root in Africa  It is worth while in this  tree as deriving       In the Nicobars where descent is claimed from a dog and a woman the dress of men is said  to be intended to simulate a doggy appearance  consisting of a fillet round the head with two ends sticking up from the knot on the forehead to resemble dog’s ears  while the private parts  are concealed in a blue  b^ with a long red point to  it   and the waist  band is arranged to fall  down behind in a tail t The earfiest Roman standards are said to have consisted of a bundle of hay on a pole  Can have been held that such a bundle of hay would be  like a growth of mistletoe  a convenient hiding place for external soul matter  just as the Kayan leaves the leafy tops of trees unpruned It might be in order to afiord a refuge for the spirits of vegetation when clearing the fields   that the same idea was present in the bandaged pole which on an Egyptian temple represented the god  the hieroglyphic for which resembles a fh^ though it is described as a hatchet and stated to be in efiect a bandaged pole with a loose flap projecting  it  f Strasser  The Mongolian Horde  p  104  relates that the Tashal Lama of Urga in Mongolia “ pressed his standards to the slit throats of his victims  saturating them in their spurting life blood ” One is tempted to see in this an attempt to imbue the standards with soul matter which would no doubt contribute towards their victorious progress   \fCHAPTER XI   414   RELIGION   and as being used as the equivalent of a human being in Assam and Oceania   Thus a plantain tree ” is in many parts of

immediately explicable on the placenta theory when one is informed that the tribe is descended from a person whose placenta The same placenta theory perhaps also at his birth was buried in a rat hole  appears in the Kora story reported by Risley from Bengal to accoimt for the fruit certain tree’s being taboo to the tribe since their ancestor once accidentally ate a human placenta which had been exposed in a tree of that particular variety  of a  Another origin of totems has been suggested as likely to be found in food We should be inclined rather to put it the other way round and regard it as perhaps to be found in peculiarities of diet  The discovery and search for forms of vegetable food must have held a very important place in early domestic economy  Under any conditions in which food was scarce and its collection uncertain and laborious  as is probably frequently if not normally the case in a preagricultural stage of existence  there must have been a tendency to conceal as long as possible the source of some hitherto unknown supply of food lest that supply Experiment in strange vegetables is dangerbe exhausted by other gatherers   restrictions   ous   particularly in the  tropics   It is therefore suggested that to the discovery  and communication to the kindred and concealment from other clans of new forms of vegetable food must be ascribed the importance of certain wild vegetables The test of whether a clan in clan ceremonial among the Naga tribes of Assam  one tribe is to be identified or not with a clan in another tribe speaking a totally dift erent language often depends on the vegetable used in certain ceremonies  If the identical plant is used the clans would be regarded as related and clansmen of one tribe going on a trading expedition into the territory of another will feel secm’e in a house of a related clan  whereas otherwise they would lie down  if at all  in fear of being awoken from their slumber by the sharp dao of decapitation  It is true that the wild vegetables used in these clan ceremonies are not always regular articles of food  but it is the writer s impression that they are always edible  Here surely is another possible source of ideas leading to the adoption of a vegetable totem by a given clan   m  It is not argued that all totems are accounted for directly by any of the ideas suggested above  Rigs’ tripe  for instance  will not quite fit  though we might perhaps suppose a fragment to have got left in a pot in which an afterbirth was hung up buffalo dung is harder still  unless dung be regarded  vide supra p  410  It is  however  likely from every point of view as a source of spontaneous life  that totemism in general has received accretions from a number of sources  and that while it may have originally started with the conception theory in ignorance of the fact of paternity  it has been encouraged and perpetuated by the ideas of life matter  a separable soul  transmigration and probably other connected ideas  and that a number of these have contributed to totemism as still found in    India   Magic  when limited to purely imitative or sympathetic magic  is rather within the domain of science than religion  There is nothing religious at all about the effort of an Ao Naga to influence the rice by planting a root or two in earth put in the hollow top of a bamboo  and so raised above the rest of the field which in the rather inconsiderate Kuki plan of putting is thus induced to grow high a bug into the brmdle of the departing guest in order that the rest of the vermin may leave the house likewise  or in the custom of giving a Prabhu bride a grind   VI  7  “ It is said that some of the Yoruba eat the In the Cameroons it is usually buried under a plantain tree and the fruit is

baby When however the efficacy of such magic depends not on the practice but on the practitioner  we may suspect that the idea of soul matter is present and that it is  often at any rate  the superfluity of this material that enables the magician to make Here again one may perhaps see the reaction of the simple his magic successful  behef that like produces like to an independent behef in the existence of soulmatter  However  that may be  a belief in magic both white and black pervades all the more ignorant classes in India and is frequently responsible for serious crime  nor is it always ehminated by culture and education  as witness the comparatively educated persons frequently victimised by rogues who profess to be able Thus  to give a single instance  in May to double currency notes miraculously  1931  a well to do merchant of Indore imprudently handed over Rs  2 800 to one Pandit Sri Karishna who claimed to have a marvellous process of doubhng notes  Ignorant villagers are much more easily imposed on  as in the case of a village near Multan in the Punjab which about the same time parted with Rs  15 000 in cash and ornaments to a Mushm Fakir who first called down a few rupees from heaven to inspire confidence in his piety and miraculous powers  and then professed to be able to turn silver ornaments into gold or one rupee into three  behef in magic again  for it can hardly be described as anything else  even if it involve the theory of the impregnation of matter with soul essence  appears in the practice  reported on good authority in Rangoon  of a director of an international trading corporation who  when ill  has sewn into the seat of his j^yjama trousers by his Catholic wife a pious fragment of the holy St  Theresa’s petticoat  What the efiect on a male Naga would be of wearing a piece of any woman’s  A  petticoat  however saintly  we hesitate to set down in print  but presumably Herr  Direktor experiences benefit   Often a belief in witchcraft leads to the murder of the reputed witch  In 1928 in Bihar for instance nine cases of murder were ascribed to witchcraft  and in 1931 in the Yarpur mahalla of Patna a small Lohar girl was murdered in retaliation for the supposed enchantments of her mother  while an “ aboriginal ” woman suspected of being a witch was killed in Ghatsila district  In Fyzabad in 1927  a man was killed on the advice of a medicine man as being the cause of another’s prolonged dysentery  and in Budaun a chamar who was suspected of having bewitched an idiot of good family was pegged out and periodically belaboured while Ultimately  the bewitched one was watched for improvement in his condition  In July 1920 a mob in the Xizam’s as there was none  the chamar succumbed  Dominions killed a woman who was believed to have brought cholera on the village  a behef arising from the hysterical statement of a possessed woman into whom had entered the spirit of the goddess who was being worshipped at the time by the village  In November 1930 in Gonda in the United Provinces a wizard was murdered by his own pupil in the belief that he  the wizard  had caused an evil spirit to destroy his ijupil’s wife and would cause it also to destroy him himself  and as the pupil was one of ten years’ standing this instance testifies to the wizard’s behef in his own system   On the other hand the witches themselves  likewise commit murders for their  own ends and to that extent anyhow justify their persecution   A boy was sacrificed  in 1928  for the purpose of exorcising evil spirits from a possessed woman  while on the eve of the Dasehra festival of 1930 two sorcerers of Sambalpur   in Bhagalpur  described by the High Court as “ men of standing ”  sacrificed a boy for some This case however may possibly have been one nefarious purpose of their own  rather of a homicide of the kind alluded to above as occasioned by the behef in the need for soul matter  The use of human sacrifice in order to exorcise spirits is probably rmusual  as it is commoner to treat the body of the possessed by more Indeed a Hindu girl was beaten to death in Lahore in Novemdirect methods  ber 1929  in the attempt to cure her of possession  and this apparently at a shrine frequented by persons in order to experience possession by the deity  In  hew however of the extent of ilhteracy and of the population concerned  the amoimt of violent crime actually due to a behef in witchcraft appears to be unexpectedly small  though naturally apt to increase with the appearance of calamities or epidemics  which are ascribable to the malevolence of witches  and in Chota Nagpur there are professional witch doctors called solcha whose business it is to indicate the witch responsible for calamity or epidemic that has occurred  M22CC  «  \fCHAPTER XI   4ie   REUGION   Personal magic  however  is not the only form in which magic appears  Tribal magic  in which the community combines  usually at some festival  in rites or dances intended to secure fertihty or prosperity  is a normal feature  Such  associated with the agriculhcence which is probably intended to have a magical effect on the fertihty of the crop and of the commimity itself  and no better instance of such a festival can be quoted than the lioli  which has survived as a Hindu festival throughout India   It is tempting  if possibly fanciful  to trace the origin of the widespread behef in the magic effect of coition on the fertility of the soil  of animals and of people in general to a period in human history when the relation between cause and effect in the begetting of children was not yet fully comprehended  but when the two were already seen to have some association  so that what was really the cause of the conception of one particular child was regarded as merely the cause of parturition in general f Such a stage in the process of deduction from observed facts  if its existence be credible  would account for the common practice of assisting the fertihty of the crops by the act of sexual coition  A reference has already been made  v  supra ch  VI  para  102  to the probable connection between fertility cults and the practice of sacred prostitution  An explanation may here be offered of the pecuhar part played by strangers in this cult  Both in the sacred prostitution of Babylon and Byblus it is clear that the dedicated woman gave herself to strangers similarly it was commerce with strangers which was so necessary to the fertihty of the fields of Kamul and so contributive to the prosperity of the people of Caindu  Yule mentions the custom as reported of the Hazaras and of other peoples  including even the Nayars  Traiiels of Marco Polo  I  212  II  56   It seems not unlikely that the underlying motive is the acquisition from the stranger of additional life matter not already inherent in the soil or its inhabitants  The soul matter of any given place may be regarded as limited in extent and the transfer from one individual to another merely redistributes but does not increase  whereas the reception of soul material from a stranger is additional to that already in circulation and will naturally therefore increase fertihty  This hypothesis likewise offers a possible explanation of the custom mentioned by Gait of the Todas  Census of India  1911  I  p  260   who are reported to call in a person from another village to deflower a girl about to attain puberty  who otherwise finds it difficult to marry  and perhaps also of the taliketta ceremony in south India generally  A possible association of the distribution in India of the brachycephalic Eurasiatic type with the practice of infant marriage has already been suggested  supra  ch  VI  para  102   The fact that approval of commerce with strangers  which is perhaps associated always with the fertility of the soil  is reported of the Uighars  Hazaras  Chukchis  Koryaks  vide Yule  Travels of Marco Polo  I  p  212 n   II  56 n    and  by a Xth century Arab traveller  of some Turks  makes it possible that this custom also has Alpine associations  Dancmg likewise has probably a magical origm  and it certainly has a magical Uftpect as when it involves leaping up the air to encourage the growth of paddy  and Russell has acutely suggested that acrobatic displays have originated in the same idea  Similarly animal dancing  such as that for instance of the Gonds  Bhatras and Rarjas of the Central Provmces  probably originates in an attempt to increase or perhaps inerely to concentrate by magic the wild animals on which the community partly depends for its food supply  When  however  the spring hunting is considered  it is apparent that the soidmatter cult is again prominent  The Aherki of the Rajput in western India  the hunting festival of the Halvakki Vakkals in Kanara  the Jur Sital of Bihar’ of tribal rehgion   festivals or rites are usually  tural year and may involve sexual     m    Unless it be the marriage festival annually celebrated in June by the lord of a feudal manor in Normandy who after participating in the bridal festivities of his serfs picked out the couples who appeared to him to be the most amorous  and caused them to consummate their mar   riages in the boughs of trees or in the waters of the local river   Dulaure speaks of this practice as one of tyrannical jesting  but the interpretation here assumed is perhaps more likely  Fertility “ le femmes prostituees rites survived in Europe in spite of the Church qui suivaient la Cour  etaient tenues  tant que le rrwi de mai durait  de faire  Dulaure   and sometimes even under its auspices as at Isernia   le  lit  du roi des ribauds”  1 1 have heard a Serna chief of great trioal authority and experience  Inato of Lumitsami  affirm that it was ridiculous to suppose that pregnancy would result from coition on one occasion only  which indicates that even now the relation between cause and effect in this ^ particular  is not completely grasped in that tribe   \fHAGIOLATRT   417  hunt of the Chota Nagpur tribes  and of the Bhatras  Gonds and Gadabas of the Central Provinces and Madras  the Sekrengi hunt of the Angami Nagas and the corresponding festivals of other Assam tribes are all designed to secure prosperity through the coming year  and inasmuch as all manner of the spring  living things are destroyed they are probably intended  the Sekrengi certainly is  to collect a supply of life essence and are to be regarded in much the same light  as the spring  man hunt of the Wa of Burma   It would be impossible  here to go into all the aspects of the tribal religion has perhaps been said to show that the beliefs held are not mere vague imaginings of superstitious and untaught min ds  “ amorphous ” as they were described in the Census report of 1911  but the debris of a real religious system  a definite philosophy  to the one time vsddespread prevalence of which the manifold survivals in Hinduism testify  linking together geographically the austroasiatic and australoid cultures of the forest clad hills where the isolated remains of the original religion still hold out in an unassimilated form  It is probably this philosophy of life essence which accoimts for the fact that in so many parts of the world  e g  in India and southern and eastern Europe  Greece and Italy in particular  the real religion of the people is hagiolatry  It is less the orthodox gods of the religion who are worshipped than shrines and holy places  generally tombs particularly associated with some deceased saint or hero likely to have been rich in soul matter  the benefit of which may be obtained at the grave  originally no doubt in the form of a material emanation  Be that as it may  showing traces in Europe on the one hand and stretching down into Australasia on the other  this creed must have been in its time a great religion  not so great perhaps in altruism  but great in extent and in constituting a very definite rung in that poor ladder up which the race still tries to climb in its eSort to ascertain the unknowable  to scale the ramparts of infinity  in India but

race  ‘  ’  ‘  EnuinmfloB of Caste  and Race   to cover the many communities still organised on that basis in whose case the tribe has not become a caste it was likewise determinate enough  and no attempt    was made to define the term race which is generally used so loosely as almost to defy definition  Nor is it intended to do anything so rash as to ‘  attempt to define it here  while in the census schedule its very looseness enabled to cover returns which  though not strictly referable all to the same category  were quite adequate for the purpose intended  which was primarily to obtain a retmn of Indians to whom the terms caste and tribe are inapplicable and a means of identifying Anglo Indians whose birthplace might be an inadequate means of identification  If an interpretation of the term race as usea in this chapter is demanded by the reader he must rest content with Sir Flinders Petrie’s definition of it as ‘‘ a group of human beings  whose type has become unified by their rate of assimilation’s exceeding the rate of change produced by foreign elements ”  It would have been inexpedient to prescribe this definition as a guide for enumerator^ Generally speaking foreigners were asked to give their nationality though this is not necessarily identical with their race  and the term British ’  if used with reference to nationality  might be correctly held to cover a Cypriot or a Maltese  or even a South American Indian with a birth place in the U  S  A   a quasi Spanish name  and an infelicitous domicile in what was once the Kingdom of Ireland  it  ‘  ’  ’  ‘  ’  ‘  ‘

including European British subjects and Armenians  only amounted to 168 134  117 336 males and 50 798 females  or 05 per cent  of the total population  The European British subjects totalled 155 555 of whom 110 137 were males and 45 418 females  Of these again 7 205 males and 3 422 females were found in Burma  and while in Burma the figures show a total increase of 1 434 males and 1 365 females since 1921 the figures for India proper show a further fall since 1921 and are now little more than 80 per cent  of those recorded in 1911  while males taken alone are fewer than in 1901  •

\fCHAPTER XII   426   CASTE  TRIBE AND RACE   The figures above show comparisons since 1901 These figures must be taken with some qualification as they certainly represent more than the actual numbers on account of the tendency of Anglo Indians who are not handicapped by excessive pigmentation to return themselves as Europeans  The total returned as European British subjects in India including Burma was 155 555 but the total number of those who were returned as born in Great Britain and Ireland was 100 150 To these may be added British subjects born in Gibraltar and Malta giving a total of 100 586 The difference between this total and that of the persons who returned themselves as European British subjects    e   54 969 gives some indication of the number of Anglo Indians who returned themselves as Europeans  In this connection it is necessary to examine the proportion of India born to Europe born in the successive age groups  In the lowest age group only 31 6 per cent  of those returned as E  B  subjects were born in Great Britain or Ireland  In group 14 to 16 this percentage rises to 39 7 per cent  in group 17 23 to 74 per cent   or in the two taken together  i e   14 23 to 70‘2 per cent   in group 24 33 where the percentage of Europe born is highest  to 77 4 per cent  After that it falls to about 63 per cent  between the ages 34 53 and to 54 4 in the group 54 and over  As no separate figures are available for European British subjects born outside Great Britain and Ireland it is necessary to make some arbitrary adjustment of figures to arrive at an estimate of the number of Anglo Indians returned as European British subjects more accurate than the mere indication given by the difference in the figures  If something over 5 per cent  be allowed for the Indian  colonial and foreign born of pure non domiciled European parentage in the lower agegroups and about half that in the highest  and if an additional 5 per cent  be allowed in the lowest group for children of European British subjects who are taken to Europe at an early age and do not return  we arrive at the figure of 58 per cent  as born in India in the lowest age ^oup  25 per cent  in the next group 14 23   and 18 per cent  in group 24 33 rising to 32 in the next two groups and to 43 per cent  in the last group  The figures thus arrived at for persons born and domiciled in India but returned as European British subjects are 12 841 aged 0 13 8 286 aged 14 23 8 987 aged 24 33   8 019 aged 34 43 4 656 aged 44 53 and 3 969 aged 54 and over  making a total of approximately 47 000 The relative proportions are illustrated in the accompanying diagrams  and the figures thus adjusted of the Europeborn and India born clearly indicate that the latter represents a comparatively normal age series  whereas the former is obviously abnormal and is entirely governed by migration  Probably it is primarily controlled by the ages of British troops  the total number of which in India amounted at the time of the census to 70 034  there were 72 151 in 1921    but in any case it completely dominates the combined curve after the age of 4 years  as may be seen by comparing the curves of annual ages for Europe born males and females  The numbers of those born and remaining in India howe  er  excluding as they must do the great majority of European s  seem to be much too high to represent only the unmixed domiciled Europeans  and it seems certain that a high proportion of this population is really AngloIndian  If  after making an allowance as above indicated for those European  British subjects of non Indian domicile who may have been born outside Great Britain and Ireland  some 35 per cent  of the remaining India born in each age group be regarded as enough  as they probably are  to represent the total of donuciled European British Subjects  we may take 30 000 as the number of Anglo Indians who should be deducted from the total of European British subjects and added to that of those returned as Anglo Indians  It has to be borne in mind that cases of marriage between male European British subjects and female Anglo Indians are probably more frequent than the reverse  and in such cases it is more than likely that the whole family will be returned as European British subjects whereas in fact that description may really apply to one member only  Be that as it may  by this calculation the figure of Europeans in India would be reduced to 125 555 say 125 500 while that of Anglo Indians is correspondingly raised from 138 395 to 168 400 In the tables of course  the numbers are given as returned at the census  part %i  Table XIX ’ The figures for European British subjects  whether in the form returned or thus adjusted  are to be compared with 185 434 persons returned as

United Kingdom by some 3 000  which is impossible  and would add 19 000 odd to the Anglo Indian total of that census 185 400  155 560 100 590 119 900   and reduce the total of genuine European In any case the decrease of the latter in 1931 is marked British subjects to 166 100  and rmequivocal   adjustment is needed for this 185 434 also   it would reduce the               Miereas in the Indian Empire the number of European British subjects is decreasing  in Burma taken by herself  on the contrary  the number of Em’opean British subjects censused in 1931 has definitely increased since 1921  though the figure at that census 7 828  showed a marked decrease on the number recorded in Nor has this total been regained which was 11 828  1931  for the Burma 1911  figure at this census is 10 627 for European British subjects and 19 200 for AngloIn Burma again if a similar adjustment be made for the return of AngloIndians  Indians as Europeans  the adjusted figures become 7 900 for European British subSome of the European British jects in Burma in 1931 and 21  900 for Anglo Indians  subjects were probably tourists  as the tourist season was not entirely over by Precise figures are not available  but as far as can be the end of February  ascertained the number is not likely to be more than about 1 000 for India and Burma together  The actual total number of all foreign tourists that passed through Burma between October and March was only 5 287      m  One noticeable feature of the 1931 figures for European British subjects is to be found in the increase of females relative to males  While the numbers  unadjusted  of males have decreased by 9 000 since 1921  those of females have decreased by In Burma they have not only increased relatively to males but absolutely by 1 365 over the 1921 figure  This increase of females is partly perhaps to be accounted for by an increasing number of Europeans in India  particularly since the war  who marry comparatively young  partly perhaps by more wives and daughters brought out to India since war conditions ceased  and in some small degree perhaps by the number of Indians who go abroad for their education and return with Emopean wives   900 only   179  The total number of Europeans other than British subjects censused in the Indian Empire was 14 353 in 1911  xArmenians included  10 546 in 1921 just after Of these nearly half did not specify the country the war  and 12 579 in 1931  of their birth  merely returning it as Em ope  and of those who did specify the birthplace some 1 500 came from France  1 000 from Germany  900 from Italy  500 each from Belgium and Turkey  and 300 from Switzerland  no other Continental nation contributing as many as 300 persons  Details will be found in pai t ii of this Volume  Table VI   Other  180  Turning to Anglo Indians we find that in contrast to Europeans the number returned at the census shows an increase of 22  4 per cent  over that in 1921 and of 122 9 per cent  on the total returned in 1881  In 1921 an Anglo Indian was described for census pm poses as a person of mixed European and Indian descent  but for the 1931 census a slightly different definition was suggested  for use where a definition was asked for  describing an Anglo Indian for census purposes as a person whose father  grand father or other progenitor in the male line was an Emopean  since it was assumed that others would probably prefer to be retmned as Indians  It is possible however that this consideration was inoperative in the case of the progeny of an Emopean or Anglo Indian woman by an Indian Christian  and the definition adopted may have been at least to that extent unsatisfactory  The actual number returned in 1931 was 138 395  71 247 males and 67 148 females   of which 61 363 males and 57 832 females were foimd in India proper and 19 200  9 884 males and 9 316 females  in Bmma  but if to these totals we add the number by which it was calculated that the total of Emopean British subjects had to be reduced  we get a total of 168 400 as the probable real number of Anglo Indians in the Indian Empire  of whom 22 000 are in Bmma  Here again however some allowance must be made in India proper for the retmn of Indian Christians as AngloIndians  It is probable that a number of the descendants of Portuguese dependants  whose practice it was to take their masters’ names and who are foimd in certain districts in Bombay and Bengal where they are known respectively as “ East Indians ” and “ Feringhis ” returned themselves at this census  as in previous  Anglo Indians   Foreigners   \fCHAPTER XU  CASTE  TRIBE AND RACE   430  decades  as Anglo Indians  The figures show that outside Bombay and Calcutta the number of such returns is very small  but it is difficult to estimate their number in the Presidency towns  It may fairly be taken  perhaps  as 3 400  so that the total number of Anglo Indians may be put at 165 000  Attention has already been drawn to their remarkable fecundity  Tribe   181 Indians returned by tribe instead of by caste form rather a heterogeneous category including Muslim tribes of Pathans  Baluchis  Brahuis or Mappillas comparatively primitive tribes like the Toda or the Nicobarese who still worship their own tribal deities others who have become partly Hinduised like most of the B bils and Gonds where the tribal name is on the way to become a caste name others largely Christianised like the Oraon or the Lushei  and others again whoUy Hindu like the Manipiui  but retaining their distinctive language and culture  In the case of the primitive tribes who are partly Christianised  comparison with the figures of previous decades has been made very difficult by the irritating practice of some missionanes to induce their converts to abandon their tribal name and return themselves nondescriptly as “ Indian Christians ”  as though they had some cause to be ashamed of their forefathers  As the question of the v elfare of primitive tribes in contact with changing conditions and progressive culture is of some importance  at any rate to the tribesmen themselves  the comparative figures of such tribes have as far as possible been collected in Table XVIII for successive decades              The Return of Caste   182 As on the occasion of each successive census since 1901  a certain amount of criticism has been directed at the census for taking any note at all of the fact of caste  It has been alleged that the mere act of labelling persons as belonging to a caste tends to perpetuate the system  and on this excuse a campaign against any record of caste was attempted in 1931 by those who objected to any    It is  however  difficult to see why the record of a fact that actually exists should tend to stabilize that existence  It is just as easy to argue and with at least as much truth  that it is impossible to get rid of any institution by ignoring its existence like the proverbial ostrich  and indeed facts themselves demonstrate that in spite of the recognition of caste in previous decades the institution is of itself undergoing considerable modification  Indeed the treatment of caste at the 1931 census may claim to make a definite  if minute  contribution to Indian unity  Thus in the tables for literacy and civil condition by selected castes the arrangement which has hitherto been on a purely provincial basis  has been changed to show collectively corresponding units from different parts of India  while the same principle  has been attempted in the tabulation of castes  How far the agitation  which was strongest in the Punjab  for the return of no caste was really due to a bona fide desire to see caste abolished  and how far it may have been due to entirely other considerations of a political nature  we cannot pretend to say  It does seem clear  however  that in some degree political considerations did contribute to an agitation which probably started with a quite disinterested impulse  It is possible also that the desire of certain sects of Hinduism to extend their numbers and influence may have contributed from a sectarian as distinct from the political standpoint  No total of Hindus who returned themselves as of no caste in India at the last census is available but 20 993 Hindus appeared in the Punjab census tables as “ caste unspecified ”  such returns being made   about half  of them coming  from  Bahawalpur State   of nil was accepted for caste as distinct from the  In 1931  a definite return individuals who on account of  ignorance or accident failed to state any caste at all  These returns of caste nil totalled 1 883 464 for India  98 of which came from Bengal  In addition to it there were 60 715 Hindus for whom no return of caste was obtained  No return of caste was insisted on from Arya or Brahmo Hindus or from Sikhs  Jains Buddhists  Muslims or Christians unwilling to make one  but where volmiteered it was recorded  and has in the case of some Muslim groups been tabulated where such groups present functional or social features obviously derived from the caste system  It is not suggested that caste rules are observed by Muslims as they are by Hindus but  though there is no ban on commensality  inter group marriage is apt to be restricted in the case of Muslim groups derived from Hindu castes  and is perhaps hardly as free as it is among the corresponding groups of Sikhs  Indian Christians who did not return their caste  and the majority do not do so  generally appeared on the schedule in this column rmder the designa‘  %  ’  \f      THE RETURN OF CASTE  tion  ‘  Indian Christian  Caste   means ignored after conversion   however  as pointed  Only  431  out elsewhere  is  by no  last June  1932  a writer in The Guardian   Madras  quoted the case of a Christian pastor in Madras  who  after presiding church committee meeting  went for a meal to the catechist’s house  As he an Adi Dravida he could only be allowed to eat by himself in the veranda and was “ had to remove his leaf  plate himself The same writer laid stress upon the part played by caste in chmch politics and the greater tolerance with which the mstitution is regarded by the Eoman Chuinh  It is of course the desire to escape from the stigma of an outcaste name that leads Indian Christians generally to return no caste  though curiously enough some Chiistians in the Central Provinces returned then caste as SoAnanii  in itself a religious sect probably schismatic from Hinduism but novc little mL re than an euphemism for Chamar    at a  ‘  It has already been suggested that facts themselves show that caste is undergoing a change  There are  however  influences at work which sometimes cut both ways  The introduction of railways  ’buses and quick communications has often been credited with a tendency to break down caste and there can be no doubt that this is true with regard to some aspects of caste  c v   distance pollution  On the other hand rapid conuiimiications seem to have acted to a certain extent as a strengthening bond  since they render possible the practice of continuing to marry within the group in spite of a change of residence to a distant place  There is no doubt whatever that in the past the migration of small groups to the areas in which they have been out of touch with their religion or caste subject to different sets of caste rules fellows  and perhaps in mediaeval times promulgated by rulers with different policies or views  has led to the splitting of castes into a number of endogamous groups which might have retained their original uniformity but for distance and failure of contact  The railway and the omnibus operate against such fission   however  apparently a tendency towards the consolidation of groups by caste rules  The best instance of such a tendency to consolidate a nuntber of castes into one group is to be found in the grazier castes which aim at combining under the term “ Yadava ” Ahirs  Goalas  Gopis  Idaiyans and perhaps some other castes of milkmen  a movement already effective This movement is generally speaking  however  poorly co ordinated as in 1921  yet and within a given group of castes the tendency some times shows itself in contradictory directions  but we may quote as typical of the movement for consolidation the desire of the artisan castes in many parts of India to appear under a common name thus carpenters  smiths  goldsmiths and some others of similar occupations desired in various parts of India to be returned by a common denomination such as Vishwakarma or Jangida  usually desiring to add a descriptive norm implying that they belonged to one of the two highest varnas of Hinduism  either Brahman or RajputJ Of the two  Brahman was usually desired at this census though in some cases a caste w’hich had applied in one province to be called Some new ranks claimed by old castes  Brahman asked in another to be called  There  is   at present separated     Old vame   1921 claims   Kamar Sonar  19 31 claims   Brahman   Kshattriya fKshattriya   Rajput Vaisya  rBraliman      Vaisya   Napit  Thakur Baidya  Brahman  Brahman  Brahman   Rawani  Vaisya  Kshattriya   Sutradar     Nai   Kahar    Muchi  Chamar  Baidya Rishi     Rajput and there are  several instances at this census of castes claiming to be Brahman who claimed to be Rajput ten years ago  Of course this movement for  consohdation with a new designation implying a high social origin is partially to be ascribed to a very prop^  desire to rise in the social estimation of other  Gahlot Rajpu  people  It is also attributable in some cases to a desire for the backing of a large commimity in order to count for more in political life  There is httle e fidence as yet that intermarriage is being practised within these consolidating groups  but it is a development the possibility of which may not be overlooked  and the Census Superintendent of the Central Provinces quotes “ specific instances of marriage between members of different sub castes of Brahmans  and between members of different sub castes of Kalars  whose union would formerly have been condemned”   Another point that has been raised at this census is a difficulty of stating a caste in the case of intercaste marriages  w^hich  few enough in pro   M22CC  Y  \f  CHAPTER XII  CASTE  TRIBE AXD RACE   432  portion to the population  appear to be increasing in number and rather tend towards the feeling  already in existence as a result of other causes  that the splitting of Hindu society into a number of castes is dangerous to the body as a whole and that divisions corresponding to the four varnas of the Vedas are sufficient There is  however  a very marked repugnance in all the castes in themselves  who have anything to say about the matter to being designated sudras  though the teini seems to have been quite respectable up to a comparatively recent date  On the whole it is fair to conclude that there is a tendency for the limitations of caste to be loosened and for rigid caste distinctions to be broken down  and if that be the case there seems to be little support for the argniment that a return On the other hand in the of caste at the census operates in the other direction  present state of society it was not possible to dispense vfith that return since in a ^ ery ccnsiderable number of cases it is essential to a knowledge of the position It is possible that in another in his en ironmcnt of the individuals concerned  ten years it ma   be feasible to substitute some other criterion and it would certainly be desirable  if it were so feasible  to adopt for census purposes some much The use of varna  however  is quite larger gi on ping than that of castes  impossible since practically every Hindu who claims to be a Hindu at all would Even castes of Chamars in the claim to be either Brahman or Kshattriya  nomenclature and at this characteristic I

to finato and since to discrin census Experience this hy pothetical data  at basis of largely on the discusssion has shown vcri  clearly the difficulty of getting a correct return of caste and likewise the difficulty of interpreting it for census purposes  The Superintendent of Census Operations for Madras in this connection writes as follows    “ Sorting foi caste  i s  reallv worthless unless  nomenclature is sufficiently fixed to render  the resulting totals close and reliable apiuoximations  Had caste terminology the stability ot religious rofuins caste sorting might be worth

unrecorded or unIndividual fancy apparently has some part in caste nomenclature  tabulated in 1021 For e xample  an extremely dark individual pursuing the occupation of waterman on the  Coorg border described lu s caste as Suryavamsa  the family of the sun ” of the claims made and appellations used recall irresistibly the ruse of that hero of W  S  Gilbert’s who “ christened himself Darwmian Man ”  and the difficulty of classifying by occupation is instanced by the fact that cultivation in northern India is a most respectable occupation whereas in certain parts of southern India it is largely associated with the “ exterior ” castes and is merchant consequently less respectable  Similarly the term would cover all sorts of different social classes and units from the Gujarati hania to the gipsy Banjara  Moreover  though it is conceded that the position of individuals belonging to exterior castes  that is to castes hitherto described as “ depressed ”  has been much ameliorated as far as public life is concerned  and that untouchability has in that respect been very appreciably reduced  all available information goes to show  that in private intercourse  as in religious observances  the castes whose water cannot be accepted are held at as great a distance as before  In so far as their position has been improved it seems to be less the result of a change of heart tow ards them than of a concession by caste to caste fpr its own convenience and not by caste to outcaste for the benefit of the latter^ The present position of the exterior castes is examined in an appendix to this volume   Many  ’  ‘  ‘  The Tabulation of Cute   ’  183 For several reasons therefore the usual treatment of caste at this census has been modified  In the first place provincial Superintendents were informed that it was not necessary generally to tabulate figures of castes for which the Local Government did not regard such tabulation as important  while as the standard of population of castes for tabulation four per mille  instead of two per mille as in 1921  was suggested as a minimum  An exception was made in the case of exterior castes and primitive tribes  with regard to which the instructions were that all should be tabulated  and ir the case of a dozen or so selected castes of wide distribution    \fTHE TABULATION OF CASTE   433  which might serve as specimens so to speak of society for all India purposes in Tables Till  XI and XIV  In tabulating castes for Table XVII the method of 1901  retained in 1911 and 1921  has been abandoned in favour of the 1891 method in which they appear gi ouped roughly by traditional occupation  references being given in different groups to individual castes to enable examples to be found in the t^hree tables of Civil Condition  Occupation and Literacy above mentioned  In reverting to the 18    1 method of tabulating caste for Table XVII  the occupation scheme used has been as far as possible assimilated to the Bertillon scheme  which has long been the basis of the Occupational 1 able  X   Admittedly this method of tabulating caste is far from being entirely satisfactory  since it can only recognise traditional occupation  which is not always a non contentious question  and cannot simultaneously recognise more than one of several traditional occupations for the same caste  as  for instance  basket making  scavenging and music many castes of associating together It does  however  admit for Doms  which are nearly related in function and origin instead of divorcing them entirely on account of an alphabetical chasm between the initial letters of their appellaIt also avoids any semblance of arrangement by order of social precetions  dence  All subsequent census officers in India must have cuised the day when it occurred to Sir Herbert Risley  no doubt in order to test his admirable theory of the relative nasal index  to attempt to draw up a list of castes according to their rank in society  He failed  but the results of his attempt are almost as troublesome as if he had succeeded  for every census gives rise to a pestiferous deluge of representations  accompanied by highly problematical histories  asking for recognition of some alleged fact or h 3rpothesis of which the census as a department is not legally competent to judge and of which its recognition  if accorded  would be socially valueless  Moreover  as often as not direct action is requested against the corresponding ^ potheses of other castes  For the caste that desires to improve its social position seems to regard the natural attempts of others to go up with it as an infringement of its own prerogative its standing is in fact to be attained by standing upon others rather than with them  For these reasons an abandonment of the return of caste would be viewed with relief by census officers  This question is one which it  vill only be po ssible to determine when the time comes  but if the exterior castes were to agree to return their religion or their community ” or by some similar adventitious label  it might bo possible as “ Adi Hindu even to omit the return of caste  while in any case it would alford a collective term which might nialce it pos sible to ignore individual castes for the purpose of tabulation and a tentative experiment in this direction ha  « been made in present   ing Table^XVII   184       •  ^  How far an abandonment of the return of caste would be a really popular  The Origin  Caste is still of vital consideration in the of Caste  structure of Indian society and of intense importance as well as interest to the majority of Hindus  It impinges in innumerable ways on questions not only of race and religion but also of economies  since it still goes far to determine the occupation  society and conjugal life of every individual born into its sphere  Some consideration of its origin cannot therefore be avoided and a number of different explanations have been offered for the existence of what is  as it is found to day  a svstem unique in the world  since there is no other country or nation which possesses an Thing approaching the elaborate caste system of India  nor is there any other country known to have ever possessed one of the same kind^ It has been described on the one hand as leading to “ a degi’ee of social disunity to which no parallel can be found in human history ”  though on the other it has probably played a very important historical role as a great contribtitor to political and cultural stability  and there is much that is true in the Abbe Dubois  eulogium of the caste system  Roughly speal ing  there may be said to be five important theories of the origin of caste  apart from the minor variations and couibinations of these five there is first the traditional view of the origin of caste there is the occupational explanatioT   of which typified in the Code of Mann the best known exponent the tribal and religious explanation of Nesfield was   family gentile the or explanation offered by Senart  and the racial and Ibbetson hypergamous explanation of Risley  None of these explanations are at all satisfactory by themselves  though all contain a definite appreciation of what should perhaps be rather described as features than causes of the caste system  The  move is rather a different question

probably to be found in two Even which appeared in the Asiatic Review in 1929 Mr  Rice  however  hardly seems to appreciate the full implications of the view he adopts   while credit must also be given to Oldenberg for having seen as early as 1907 that tabus on commensahty were pre  Aryan in origin  nearest  articles by Stanley Rice        Before attempting to suggest the true causes which have led to the growth of caste in India  it will perhaps be necessary to examine briefly the various views  The first of these is the traditional view of which the Code taken as the prime exponent  Caste  according to this view  is based on four varnas or “ colours ” sprung from difierent parts of the Creator’s  mentioned above  of Manu may be  body and subject to certain prohibitions as to marriage  food and occupation  breach of which has led to loss of position  while the enormous number of existing castes between which inter marriage and commensahty is banned  is accounted for by unions  hcit or illicit  between one and another of these castes hypergamous marriages having given rise to clean castes  and marriages  which we may perhaps describe as hiy pogamous  between a male of a lower position and a female of higher  stigmatised as pratiloma that is against the grain ’  having given rise to the out castes who  though Hindu or at least quasi Hindu by rehgion  are outThis traditional view is based on a Rigvedic side the pale of decent Hindu society  hymn which  if it cannot be said to be spurious  is at least much later in composiThe view is generally discarded by all critics tion than the bulk of the Rigveda  as an artificial systematisation composed centuries after the origin which it professes to explam  and has been clearly shovm by Senart to be an attempt to interpret in terms of an Indo European social system parallel to that of Rome an existmg order  which  at any rate at the time of application  the terms carmot be    ‘  made to fit  The second view derives caste entirely from occupation  The principal exponent of this view was Nesfield who regarded the j^resent division of Indian society into castes  which are largely occupational  as indicating the origin of the whole system  His position is supported by Dahhnann who likewise sees in a village  community  practising  a particular trade or  craft the origin of a  caste  through the formation of a guild which in course of time has become exclusive both in the matter of commensahty and that of marriage  One of the arguments on which this view of the origin of caste is based is drawn from a supposition that the lowest castes in this scale are those which practise a craft in which no metal is used  the higher castes being those which involve the use of metal  the inference being that the non metal using castes became closed guilds as a result of the arrival of subsequent peoples using metal  and these in their turn became closed guilds which did not intermarry with the former non metal using villagers  This theory will hardly stand critical examination  It is true that basketmaking is an occupation of one of the lowest castes at the same time the blacksmiths’ caste is very far from being more highly esteemed  though it must be considerably later in point of time  than that of the coppersmith or the goldsmith  Moreover  this scheme does not explain at all the varying positions of agriculturahsts who are of low castes in certain parts of southern India but generally of respectable if not of high caste in northern India  It should be  however  mentioned in this connection that it does appear to be a custom in southern India or in parts of southern India to provide a craftsman  that is  a man of the carpenter s or blacksmith s or goldsmith s profession with a grave made of stone slabs in a cist form in place of the simple unlined grave which is given to a cultivator  and this does suggest either a difierence in status or in custom between the aborigines and immigrants who brought in tools and crafts  or in the alternative       some difierence in eschatolog ’ between the cultivator and the craftsman  The parallel  however  which is drawn between caste and the guild system of the later  Roman Empire  although at first it appears quite close  breaks dowm on examination  The later Roman Empire attempted to compel every person to follow  the profession into  which he was born  but this was purely  economic in origin    This applies also to Dr  Bonnerjea’s hypothesis published in the Indian Antiquary in 1931 criticising Rice for regarding caste as predating the Aryan invasion he regards the system  Whde  as introduiwl by the Indo Europeans  but nevertheless ascribes the institution to primitive superstition and to a belief in m agic Dr  Guha advanced a similar view in a thesis before Havard University in 1924  I agree in ascribing caste to a I cannot accept the rest of Dr  Bonnerjea’s hypothesis which appears belief in magic  though to me to be con tradictory  It may be added that the theory of caste here put forward was arrived at before I had seen either Rice s or Bonnerjea’s articles and was independent oi their conclusions   \fTHE ORIGIN OF CASTE   435  and did not involve any ban on commensality between one profession and another  and what might appear to be a ban on intermarriage in that a man was compelled under certain conditions to adojjt the profession of his wife s father  was really only an attempt to recruit persons for certain unpopular professions a shortage in which was inconvenient to the State  It is inconceivable that any such purely artificial system as a caste distinction based solely on function could possibly give rise to the vivid and lasting prejudices that accompany caste distinctions in India   The third explanation of the caste system has been sought in a tribal origin  Ibbetson attributed the development of caste to a combination of tribal origins  functional guilds and a Levitical religion ’  and he laid the greater stress in this on the tribe  It is quite clear that tribes are just as much responsible for the origin of certain castes as it is that certain castes are or have been in the past restricted At the same time Ibbetson’s explanation of the origin to particular functions  These of caste is really only a summary of certain observable features of caste  features  that is  tribes  guilds and religious monopolies  have certainly contributed to the growth of the caste system  having no doubt done much to consolidate and perpetuate it  but they can in no sense be regarded as causes  They are features which are not uruque and are common to many countries  whereas caste is something that is found nowhere else  Given caste  a tribe  a guild or a priestly order may very easily become a caste  but if the essentials of caste are not there to stajt with it is difficult to see how any of these groups with the possible exception of the priestly order  would be hkely to develop into one  ‘  The fourth attempt to explain caste that we have mentioned is Senart’s asHere again we are unable cription of its origin to the gens and to family worship  The gens would appear to be essentially to agree with the explanation put forw’ard  other than caste and to correspond to gotra  which so far from being synonymous with caste  definitely runs counter to it  A caste in India seldom if ever claims a common ancestor  though the gotra like the gens insists on common ancestry  Moreover the mere existence of a number of gotras within a caste  but not confined to it  seems to preclude Senart’s supposition that the exclusiveness of caste originated in family worship  The fifth explanation of caste is Risley’s derivation from colour and hypergamy  This derivation appears to fail to explain satisfactorily the taboo on food and marriage  In order to base caste on hypergamy  Risley has found it necessary to postulate a fictitious point at which the result of intermarriage provides enough women to enable a society to close its ranks and become a caste  although there still exist outside it more women of the same community from which it has been drawing its wives and with whom it has been in more or less intimate relations  Apart from this consideration the nearest parallel to caste which can be found goes somewhat perhaps to support Risley’s theory that is  the position of the negroes in the southern states of the U  S  A  Westermarck  History of Human Marriage  1901  pages 365 7  supports this view  but although separate carriages  separate restaurants and even separate towns are provided for negroes  no pollution takes place as a result of having negro servants and there is no hard and fast line which is really analogous to a caste division between  say quadroons and octoroons  nor have the many social factors  which have tended in India to produce similar results in regard to foreigners  such as the Moghals or the English  really succeeded in making Muslims or Anglo Indians into a caste in the Hindu sense  and where IMuslims form a real caste it is always one which has been converted from pre i Iuslim inhabitants and retained its pre Islamic organisation  Colonel Sewell points out an additional respect in which the parallel breaks down in that in the Indian case the superior population consisted of invaders presumably anxious to preserve their racial identity and their social superiority  whereas in the American case the negro was in the first instance imported for the purpose of providing labour  In any case  if we reject Risley’s derivation of caste from race  we must nonetheless admit the part that varna has played in crystallising and perpetuating that institution  which could hardly have come down to posterity in its present form without having been subjected to the reagent of racial prejudice and discrimination     Of recent Indian writers on caste  one  Prof  N  K  Dutt   while criticising Risley adopts in effect his theory of origin  though attaching much more value to Origin and growth of CoMtc in India  Calcutta  1931    M22CC  \fCHAPTER XII   436   CASTE  TRIBE AND RACE   the code of Maiiu  and  tlr  Hayavadana Rao   and Dr  Ghuryet likewise regard caste as having arisen largely as a residt of racial difference  The latter emphasises the factor of priestly manipulation hy Brahmans attempting to maintain the purity Like the others the latter theory cannot be regarded of race of the Aryan invaders  as adequate in itself  and though it may represent an important contribution to the ultimate establishment of a hard and fast system  it does not appear probable on the face of it that priestly dominance could have effected so much  unless the essential factors of the system were already present and predisposed to be used for such a purpose and in this connection it seems necessary to draw attention to an important paperj by A  M  T  Jackson  J  A  S  B  Ill  No  7 of July 1907  who points out effectively the contributions of political divisions and of the royal prerogative in early India to the formation of sub castes  The latter author  however  explicitly disclaims any attempt to indicate the origin of the system  and it is with its ultimate origin rather than the process of its development that we are here con   cerned   Seeing that light is required on the origin of caste it would seem not unreasonable  as in the case of religion  to examine first those cultures that survive in India least altered from antiquity in  case they can illumine origins elsewhere obscured  by changes and developments due to growing civilization and to external contacts  Ca ste  as it now is  is an institution which has grown and developed through man y centuries  but since it is so firmly rooted in India  and since it is found nowhere else  it would appear almost certain  on the face of it  that its first beginnings are to be sought in India and not outside  and we have fortunately in the more inaccessible corners of this vast country still a few tribes whose primitive conditions of life have changed so little in a thousand years as to be witnesses of value  Pliny the Elder  writing in the first century A  D   mentions Abariman  the untamed hills of the eastern Himalayas  whose inhabitants are still spoken of by the Assamese in the precise term used by Pliny ahari manu  and Ptolemy  writing in the second  locates “ the Nanga logae  that is the realm of the naked ” precisely where the  S aga log are found today  some tribes of them still unclothed  still untouched by contact with the people of the plains  tribes who have never seen a white man nor a horse nor know what is gun powder  and whose language is still unspoken by any one outside their own community save some of their immediate neighbours  Hinduism  Buddhism and Islam have never penetrated here  and caste as it exists in the plains is unknown and rmdreamed of  but nevertheless institutions are found which seem to throw a definite light on caste and religion as they have developed in another enviromnent § Thus in the unadministered area to the east of the Naga Hills  where each village is an independent political unit  there is very often to be seen a distribution by villages of certain occupations  Thus some villages make pots but do not weave cloth others weave  and others again are occupied principally with blacksmiths’ work  the one village bartering its products with its neighbours  when not prevented by mutual hostilities  in spite of differences of language  cnstoms and sometimes perhaps of race between one village and another  °Here v e ha  e clearly the occupational aspect of caste origins on which so much emphasis has been laid by Nesfield and Ibbetson  and indeed the remnants of such a condition seem to have survived in northern India until the Buddhistic age  as the Jatakas indicate that certain trades were localised in separate villages  some containing potters  others smiths and so forth  but it is not the only aspect  It frequently happens that upheavals in village politics end in battle  vendetta and sudden death  and that as a consequence part of a village community  usually an exogamous clan or sept  is compelled to migrate to some other village  It might be anticipated that a group of weaving families would be welcomed in a pot making village which only obtained cloth by barter  and vice versa  and up to a point this is indeed the case numbers are strength and such immigrants are generally welcomed and allowed to settle and cultivate  but not to ply their ancestral craft when that differs from the occupation of their ho sts  That is tabu  and should the strangers insist on it they must again go elsewhere to some village in which it is permitted  lustances of this have occurred within the writer’s personal knowledge and the underlying feeling seems to be that the practice of the tabued craft will aPect the crops and the fruits of the earth generally  perhaps  because it is an       offence to the    Indian Ca^te System  Bangalore 1931    ^    Caste and Race in India  London  1932    t

spirits who are generally regarded as the source of fructification  437    or it  may be that the particular form of mana or aren which enables the manufacture of the article made by the strangers is liable to neutralise the corresponding magic on which the traditional village industry depends  Here however there is generally speaking no tabu on commensality or on intermarriage  and for the sources of these aspects of caste we must look elsewhere   For a possible source of the commensal tabu  however  we need not look far from that of the occupational one  The same l saga communities which we have been considering afiord abundant instances of tabus on certain foods  of a vivid belief in matia or  as the Ao Naga calls it  areti  and of the magical effects of food on the consumer  It has already been pointed out  v  sup   page 414  that certain foods are peculiar to certain exogamous clans  and are in many cases associated with clan ceremonial  and it may be offered as one hypothesis that the presence of strange craftsmen practising their craft is condoned or rather rendered less dangerous by the prohibition of intimate relations with them  reducing thus the inconvenient strictness of one tabu bv erecting another which at the start mav be less irksome  That this is in accordance  vith the spirit of the primitive society under consideration is demonstrated by the readiness with which in some tribes the proximity of Christian converts is tolerated  even though they cultivate on tabued days  provided they live outside the village fence and therefore form a more or less separate community  though here again commensality is not barred  except indeed in so far as the Christians refuse to eat such flesh as they are taught to regard as “ meats offered to idols Another hypothesis  and there is no reason to suppose the suggested explanations to be mutually exclusive  is the theory that the food of strangers is itself dangerous  Senart’s citation of the tabu on strangers at the family meal would doubtless lead back to this and Rice’s view of the tabu on commensality as derived from a belief in totemism agrees in effect with the hypothesis here put forward  since both depend for their force on the belief in mmia and in the resulting tabu on food or other contacts which may be infected mth the dangerous soul matter of strangers this soul matter is particularly perilous if such strangers have new and  what is the same thing  mysterious arts and therefore magical powers  Thus when the vuiter was touring in previously unvisited Naga territory in 1923 24 he found villages which not only objected to accepting presents or purchase money of any kind from the strangers or to parting with any possession to them for fear of the influence to which they might thus become subject by proxy as it were  but they actually destroyed mats or other property lent to build shelters when the visitors who had used them had gone  and threw avray their tainted coins in the The differentiation between cooked and uncooked food as a vehicle of jungle  pollution so familiar to any observer of caste in India is clearly traceable to this view of the infection  by the act of cooking  of the food cooked with the ma7ia of Similarly among the Maori  to quote Eldon Best  “ the most soulthe cooker  destroying thing according to native ideas is tanmoa  deprivation of tap7i by means of cooked food  A tabu on intermarriage coidd easily be traced to a similar source if not to the same one  among the Mafulu of Xew Guinea no girl who is not a near relative of a bachelor may even see him eat   and once accepted would be tremendously strengthened and indefinitely perpetuated by the practice of hypergamy and by the comparative racial exclusiveness as regards marriage of the IndoEuropean invaders of the 2nd millenium B  C     The sentiments and beliefs  therefore  on which caste is based presumably go back to the totemistic proto australoid and to the austroasiatic inhabitants of preDravidian India and we may conceive of their becoming effective on contact with Dravidian speaking strangers bringing new crafts from the west  Hence would arise local tabus against certain crafts and persons  tabus tending to become tribal and to erect rigid divisions between communities  Even in early vedic hterature different words appear for identical occupations  With culturally superior strangers hypergamy must almost certainly arise  and if there came a foreign priesthood with the ancient sciences of south west Asia  the belief in their magical powers would make them the most heavily tabued of all  The sea has receded in the Persian Gulf  and Larsa and Lagash  Ur  and Eridu were no great   Indeed it is stated that “ a bead of amazonite from the Ndghary HUls of India was dug up from a prediluvian layer at Ur ”   0  G  S  Crawford in Antiquity  VI 2S9   but Mr  Mackay states that “ there mnst have been other sources of green felspar as it

would take time to estabhsh  and it is natural in caste typical of therefore to find allusions in the later vedas to the absence of any absolute ban on the taking of food cooked by sudras  and Apastamba’s statement  II  2  3 a reference for which I am indebted to Rai Bahadur Eamaprasad Chanda  clearly suggests that for nonceremonial jtuiposes it was not necessary to be so particular  It is therefore argued not that caste in its present form is not a post  Aryan development  but that the essential ingredients which made the growth of caste possible were of pre Aryan origin and without them the development of caste would not and could not have taken place     In this connection there is a bye issue worth consideration   that is the position The explanation of the degraded position in Manu’s code of the fratiloma castes  they there hold is generally regarded as a more or less fictitious exposition of the hypergamous ideal  but even from the most diehardly hypergamous point of view a httle difficult to see why the fruit of an hypogamous imion should stand lower in the social scale than castes whose ancestors contained no drop at all of the blood of the patrician invader  Granting that for the sake of schematic balance and of the AristoteUan principle of perversio optimi pessimum the ofispring of a Brahman woman by a Sudra should rank below that of a Kshattriya by a Sudra  it might still have been expected that either would be regarded as superior to a mere Sudra of unmixed blood  It is therefore suggested that Manu’s rules of precedence are derived in this respect from social conditions in which the tmion of a woman of the invading race with one of the indigenous race was necessarily anomalous  Now if the invaders were  like the Indo Europeans elsewhere  a patrilineal society and if the indigenous race was matrihneal as the original Mediterraneans seem to have been and as the Dravidian speakers of Malabar still are  the fruit of a male invader and a female indigene would have a recognised position in either society under either the ‘tnakkathayam or the niaruftiakkathayam principle  and whether the marriage were patrilocal or ma trilocal  but the issue of a female invader by an indigenous male would have no place in either  Since he could not claim kinship through his mother with her exogamous patrilineal class  nor through his father with his matrilocal matrihneal family  and having no claim on family property under either system  his position would tend to become degraded  which would account for the low status given in Manu’s code promulgated at a date when the precise causes of the low position were no longer clear and called for some sort reflection of this amalgamation of the two cultures of formahst explanation  is possibly to be seen in the employment by Hindus of the daughter’s or sister’s son or husband in certain rites as an alternative to the employment of a Brahman It is hardly necessar ^ to point out that such  v  Punjab Tribes and Castes  I  392   circumstances  under which patrihneal invaders took wives from matrihneal indigenes  would also operate very strongly towards the erection of a purdah system  The woman under the matrihneal system has a freedom not dissimilar to that of The woman taken from a matrihneal society and the man under the patrihneal  having ties of language  kinship  acquaintance and custom with that society  but expected to live according to strange and probably repugnant domestic and marital rules  could only be effectively restrained to that end by cutting off her freedom of movement in and association with the society to which she belonged  It may appear at first sight that the case of a Nambudri Brahman married to a Nayar wife is a contrary instance  since she does not observe purdah at all  but the fact that in this case the childien follow the matrihneal system supports the argument that purdah was necessary to the combination of a patrilineal svstcm with the it is  A  \f439  THE OBIGIN OF CASTE   That purdah should exist so practice of taking wives from a matrilineal society  elder of the sons must be explained ’i dves Nambudri the of case strongly in the of a matrithe encroachment against barrier  a maintaming for by the necessity practised already the Nambudri that probabihty the by and environment liueal purdah when they first arrived in Malabar  That the purdah system was alien to the Eigvedic Aryans when they invaded India  the Eigveda itself is a mtness  while there is nothing v hatever to associate it with the Mediterranean stock which seems to have followed the matrihneal system in which purdah has no natural It is perhaps significant in this connection that purdah is weaker in place at all  than in the north  and in Madras at any rate gets w eaker from India of south the north to south  where  conversely  caste gets stronger  It is conceivable that the same circumstances gave rise to the practice of the pre puberty marriage of girls as to that of purdah  and  infant marriage again is least prevalent in the extreme south   The view that caste corresponds to race has here been rejected  as it is clear that the two do not coincide  The Brahman of the United Provinces has a long head  c  i  73 1   he of Bengal a roimd one  c  i  79 0  the cephahc index of the Chamar of the U  P  is 72 8  and that of the Bihar Chamar 76  and the same diSerrences  which correspond  as explained later  to different migrations into India  At the same time that is not to say that are to be found likewise in other castes  between caste and race  Though curiously kind of any correlation no is there corresponding U  P  and Bihar the castes in each of position relative the enough pair named above is reversed according to that test  Eisley’s theory of the nasal  index has a definite basis on facts  It cannot be denied that there is usually a clear relation between social status and the nasal index and that the latter varies according to the admfl ture of aborigmal  that is of proto australoid  blood  though in regard to later immigrant strains caste cannot be similarly correlated to race on any systematic basis  Further in any consideration of caste and race it is impossible to overlook the effect of the famines which have frequently visited India Famine so severe as to reduce people even to eating their own kind in the past  is vouched for by more than one account   and there can be little doubt but that from time to time such famines must have led to loss of caste on a considerable scale  and though where many have lost it together the result may have been merely the formation of sub castes  small groups must have often been driven to associatIn ing wnth some caste lower in status rather than five an isolated existence  effect therefore there must be racial elements common to all castes though in very varying degrees  and racial elements have again been imported into caste by the formation of castes from tribes  This process must have been common enough in the past  and indeed may still be seen working  Jats  Gujars  Kohs or Kaibarttas may be cited as examples in which the process is complete  while it is still in duration iu the cases of Panikas  Gonds and Oraons  for instance  and it must frequently have happened that the chiefs of a tribe have ultimately been accepted as Eajputs while the rank and file have failed to achieve so high a status  It is similarly a commonplace that castes frequently owe their origin to religious sects which  after recruiting adherents from many sources  close their ranks to external marriage     •  It has been pointed out that the social estimation accorded to any given caste That is to say that under the in northern India depreciates from west to east   hypergamous

whole  regarded as less orthodox than those of the west coast  185 The Census Eeport of 1901 laid the foundations on which has since been based all work that has been done on the racial composition of

hybridized tribes in the Malav Peninsula and in the Indian Archipelago is well established  but he ha s left few traces on the mainland of India and Burma  In the Kadars and Uralis of the forests of the extreme south of India occasional individuals with frizzly hair and low stature and negrolike features are very suggestive of smvivals of the Negrito race  The theory of such a negrito survival in southern India  particularly among the Kadar  has several times been advanced  e ^   by K  T  Preuss  Keane  Islands   and Haddon  It has been as frequently denied  most recently by Dudley Buxton and by Eickstedt  but it must be taken as now definitely established by Dr  B  sS  Guha  a reference to whose measurements and photographs in part iii of this volume will probably be admitted conclusive  Some survivals of this sort are after all only what would be expected  seeing that there are Negrito tribes Sergi  still in existence in  Indonesia  while Ghuffrida Ruggeri maintains the pre existence  of a coastal race of Negritos between India and the Persian Gulf and their survival  in Susiana up to historic times    Giuffrida Ruggeri also suggested that the brachycephaly of southern Arabia this is substantiated by the low stature of southern Arabs and their occasional curly hair  Sir Arthur Keith does not  however  put forward the suggestion of Negrito affinities in his analysis of the head forms of southern Arabia in Appendix I to Bertram Thomas’ Arabia Felix  1932   though he confirms Seligman s conclusion that the southern Arab is brachycephalic  coming to the conclusion that despite a certain Armenoid admixture “ there exists in South Arabia a brachycephaly which is relatively unique a wide short skull of medium height  but with non  Armenoid dimensions  i e   postauricular length  ”  Dixon  Racial History of Man  suggests that this brachycephalic population of southern Arabia is Alpine in origin and would explain the negroid characters found as due to the importation of slaves from Africa  If GiuffridaRuggeri is right in postulating a Negrito strain along the Persian Gulf  it is conceivable that an African origin is thereby indicated for the distribution of Negritos in In the alternative  and the pre existence of the Negrito in Elam or Indone sia  is due to an ancient negritoid substratum and that       First Outlines of ~a Systematic Anthropology Volkerschichien

established  we can only postulate a very early distribution from Central Asia  The former origin would perhaps be more in accordance with Keith s view  Human Races Old and Neiv  of three main types having arisen in Europe  Asia and Airica respectively  whereas the latter would be necessary to Hooton’s view  which is ably supported by Sewell  Origin of Man and the Population of India   that dolichocephaly has its origin in Africa and brachycephaly in Asia  In the latter event we must perhaps conclude that the negroid characters of Negrito tribes are modifications as a result of an environment In either case it is similar to that which has acted upon the Negro of Africa  generally admitted that the Negrito represents the oldest surviving type of man and it is possible even that he preceded Neanderthal man  by whom  according to Griffith Taylor  he was displaced and dispersed  In any case the Negrito seems As already indicated traces to have been the first inhabitant of south eastern Asia of his stock are still to be seen in some of the forest tribes of the higher hills of the extreme south of India  and similar traces appear to exist in the inaccessible areas between Assam and Burma  where a dwarfish stature is combined with frizzly hair such as appears to result from recent admixtures of the pure or virtually pure Negrito stock of the Andamans with blood from the mainland of India or Burma  There are also legends among the Kuki and Kachari tribes of Assam of former contact with and of the extermination of a dwarf race armed with bows and spears living in dense forest and of an implacable hostility such as that still displayed by the Jarawas of Great Andaman Island to all their neighbours  What  if anything  in the way of culture the Negrito has bequeathed to his supplanter is a matter for speculation  but since he has existed in the Andamans in a condition of    hostile isolation for many centuries it is just possible that the bow is his invention  It is also to be noted that he possesses a cult of the dctu tree which is or has been  associated in southern Europe  Africa  and Oceania wnth fertility and with the souls of the dead  as it still is in India  and that he also possesses his own version of the legend of the Path of the Dead to Paradise guarded by an avenging demon  which is so wide spread in Indonesia and its neighbourhood  If he did not evolve these conceptions for himself and bequeath them to others  the fact that he possesses them at any rate points to their distribution at a very early period of human prehistory  If the Negrito was the earliest inhabitant of southern Asia he must have been This dolichocephalic type early displaced or supplanted by the Proto australoid  the The view that Australian is connectappears to have had its origin in the west  rejected by weighty authorities  though repeatedly ed with Neanderthal man   seems to die hard  since Hrdlicka apparently regards the Neanderthal as having contributed to existing human types  while Sewell  Origin of Man  etc   appears to revert to that theory of Australian origins  and in his account of the Mohenjodaro skulls he definitely associates the Indian Proto australoid type with the Australian In this aboriginal on the one hand and with the Rhodesian skull on the other  discovery near been justified by the Mt  in to have since Carmel he

soloensis recently discovered in Java is the direct ancestor of the Australian aborigines  Nevertheless Colonel Sewell has himself pointed out to this writer the possibility of the derivation of the Proto australoid type in India from a leptorrhine western type through a series of climatic modifications   What he writes is “ a comparison of the Mohenjodaro skulls with those from Kish   Al Ubaid  Aditanallur and the skulls of the Yeddahs indicates that w e have a transition series commencing in the Kish skulls with a nose that is long and narrow% passing through the Al Ubaid skulls w’here the nose is slightly shorter and broader  then through the Aditanallur and Mohenjodaro skulls in w hich these changes are more marked to the maximum alteration found in the Veddahs Similarly the series presents corresponding relations in the height of the orbit and the degree of prognathism  as w ell as in the bizygomatic breadth ”  He has added in conversation that the series could be prolonged unbroken from Kish westw^ards to terminate in an Anglo Saxon skull  but would probably admit the possibility of modification by hybridization as a possible alternative to modifiation by climate    E g

preserA ed from that site are of equal antiquity to that of their surroundings and the inferences to be draivn from the accounts given indicate that the human skeletal material is probably of

knoAi’n  and Peake and Fleure suggest that the first pottery was made from leathern models in the neighbourhood of the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates or north Syria  while Frankfort considers that the earliest Susa pottery had such an origin  The presence of the boomerang  as also of the blowgun in south India and in a rudimentary or degenerate form in Assam  may possibly be credited to them  and in the domain of religion probably totemism  of a neolithic culture  since some of the  Like the Proto australoid and unlike the Negrito the Melanesian division of the Oceanic Negroes is dolichocephalic  and the frizzly hair which is so typical of the Melanesian   Ossibly indicates a hybrid origin  and it seems likely that the Melanesian represents a stabilised type deriAed from mixed Negrito and Proto australoid elements  HoAyever that may be  Melanesian elements are apparent in India and Burma  though limited in distribution and doubtful in origin  as there seems to haA e been at

mainland  it is impossible to isolate the Melanesian for examination not only from the Austroasiatic and Indonesian groups referred to below  but also from Malay intrusions which are present in Burma  in Assam and probably elsewhere   The term Austroasiatic is a linguistic rathe than a racial term and as such has been referred to above in Chapter X  where the questions involved in that of the Mund  languages have been briefly discussed  Linguistic as it is however the term Austroasiatic has certain quite definite cultural association in India  Burma and Indonesia  the most prominent of which have already been mentioned  but to which might tentatively be added the practice of terraced cultivation  which north of the Godavari in India is found roughly corresponding to the distribution of Austria languages  though by no means universaily  Thus the Bawara  Sara  of the Madras Agency Tracts have terraced fields which will almost compare with those of the Angami Xagas  while their cousins the Bantals  Hor  i ppa ivi tly have not  It is however a practice that might easily lie lost m the course of migration  and the Sawara    Saharia ”  of Central India has himself apparently lo st it thi s  or in the It has been suggested that the least unsatisalternative has failed to accpiire it  factory theory of the distribution of these languages is that they have migrated eastwards down the Ganges valley to the Bay of Bengal  The suggestion that they are connected with the agglutinati  e Sumerian language has more than once been put forward  e g   by Rivet in 1929  and apparently with some degree of jilausibility  and in that case it seems likely that we mu st look still further west for their origin  Handy in his suggested map of PoKmesian origms traces two courses of pre historic migration from west to east  one round the coasts of India the other north of the Himalayas   It seems reasonable to postulate an alternative route across India and the Bay of Bengal for Elamites and dwellers in Mesopotamia of the Mediterranean race to have reached the Indian Archi  ekgo  For overlaid as it is with Pareoean elements and confused with submerged negroid races  the basic type of the nesiot race is generally regarded as Mediterranean in origin and as having derived even its pre historic cultures from the mainland of xVsia  It seems just possible that the leptorrhine features and fair skins so often to be seen among the Xamasudras of Bengal which are so much at variance with their low social position may be due to settlements left behind in the course of this migration t The possibility of repercussions from the Indonesian area westwards on India has already been m entioned in Chapter X  It seems definitely ckar that there has been a movement north westwards from the

leaving only narrow channels of sea between this reconstructed area and the Phihppines  the Celebes  Lombok  Flores and Timor  and providing the easiest of short passages from island to island from Borneo and Bah to New Guinea and Austraha  Not onlv does this reconstruction explain the connection between the Proto australoids of India  and Indonesia  and the Austrahans proper  but if it is a correct reconstruction  and to account for the peophngof Austraha in pre historic times it is perhaps a necessary one  it is then clear that its disappearance must have involved either  some great cataclysm or a series of smaller ones accounting not only for traditions such as those of the Assam hills but also for a dispersal of part of the population westwards having Austroasian languages and probably strains of Melanesian and of Pareoean or even Malayan blood   The above speculation has been offered with some diffidence as hkely to be condenmed as fantastic  and indeed it is tendered in profound ignorance of geology  At the same time it may be permitted to a layman to observe that during the last decade tlie researches of acknowledged geologists have been somewhat seismic themselves  and the eruptions of Wegener and Kroeber have shaken several previously accepted hypotheses  Molengraaff and Weber have pointed out that the distribution of fresh water fish in the Islands suggests that they had the elevation In any case it may here be added that the indicated in the not very distant past  theory put forward of an Indonesian cataclysm is anything but essential to an hypothesis of intrusions on the mainland of India and Burma of nesiot speech and Even less is it required to explain the presence of mongoloid elements  culture  If the map of the area occupied by Tibeto  Chinese languages in para  157 be again referred to it will be seen that although it may be said to fringe upon the area of Indo European languages  there is a very considerable overlap in places  In all this overlapping area the Indo European languages are definitely intrusive and the mongoloid element in the population is strong enough to retain its own languages  It is further possible that the extension of mongoloid physical elements has gone a good deal further than the present range of their languages would suggest  On  of the Mohenjodaro skulls has been identified as de iitely Monstolian

fan shaped head dress very suggestive tures of that type  of head dresses still to be seen in the Himalayas  On the other side of India the physical type of the Muslim cultivator in Eastern Bengal is strongly sugges   mixed Mongolian and Proto au straloid strain  Buxton  as we have suggests that the Pareoean element extends to southern India  Burma  of course  is almost completely mongoloid and though the existence of other strains is undoubted they are no longer easy to isolate  There are protoaustraloid elements probably in some of the hill tribes  and on the Assam side a Melanesian strain is to be expected  The survival of Mon Khmer languages tribes suggests the probable presence of a nesiot the Tlon  Palaung and strain of blood likewise  and the strain may be taken as certainly present in the Mawken  Selung  tribe   the Burmese type generally is brachycephalic and plat TThine  and these features appear to be predominant throughout Burma  and to have imposed themselves on the remnants of the Mons of Pegu  originally alien to them  in which case the Burman seems to have assimilated that race physically as he has culturally  the Mon having before that already assimilated the dolichocephalic leptorrhine element introduced from Telingana by the Takings  an element stiU occasionally traceable in Mon families  unless it be that this is only another instance of the survival of the Indonesian type frequently met with at any rate in the hills to the west of the Chindwin  It is possible that the Karen has also some nesiot element  as in culture and appearance the tribes  and the Karen language has so far Hill Karen seems to merge into not been definitely classified and may prove to be nearer to the Austric than   to the Chinese Tai groups  The bulk of evidence with regard to the Karens points to their having come from the direction of China  but McMahon quotes Cross as tive of a  seen   m  Wa  Wa  \fMOKGOLIAN   449  recording a tradition that the Karens once lived to the east of a great body of water  “ the largest in the world ”  which “ runs backward to its source ”  and as interpreting this as the Bay of Bengal  but in that case it seems highly improbable that this Kaiv or Kho would not have been explicitly pointed out as such  The Changs of the since the Karens are still in contact with the shores of that Bay  Kaga Hills have a similar story of a great river far to the south that runs do i^mwards till it meets a rock and thence with great force flows upwards  so that navigaHandy has pointed out  Polynesian Origins  that from tors are carried away  between Luzon and Formosa there rushes out “ a current so Bashi Strait the saihng vessel sucked into it is flung out toward Micronesia ”  The that any strong Chmese called it “ a monster that swallows unwary vessels ”  and Handy goes on to quote a Cantonese book of the Xllth century which says “ To the east of Java is the great Eastern Ocean Sea where  the surface of  the water begins to go downward there is the kingdom of women  Still further east is the place where the Wei lu drains it  the world from which men do not return ”  This he regards as a reference to the Bashi Strait  which is however  as he points out  north east of Java  It is tempting to see in that current the river of Karen and Chang tradition  and it may be added that the Changs have other stories very suggestive of Mon Khmer affinities  identical as they are with legends of the Khasis and Syntengs  Subsequent waves of hlongolian immigration have passed over Burma since  obUterating the traces of former movements and assimilating their stock  and both these processes have been intensified by the policy of massacre and deportation which makes the medieval history of Burma so profoundly depressing to read  The race movemeiit of Jlongohans soutliwards still continues among the Kachin tribes  while the Kuki Chin tribes have barely settled down after reaching the Bay of Bengal and starting to work northwards again on the Assam side of the dividing ranges  The bulk of Burma in any case is primarily mongoloid  and any non Mongolian streams of migration that may have reached India through Burma have absorbed a vast quantity of iMongohan blood  In Assam even the Khasis and Syntengs  though they have managed to retain their Austric language  differ little in physique from their TibetoBurman speaking neighbours  Elsewhere in India south of the Himalayas even Mongolian languages have net survived  and there is little trace of their influence except in the mongoloid cast of physical features that crops up unexpectedly with fair frequency in northern India  particularly along the foot of the hiUs  Their contribution to Indian culture west of Assam has probably been negli   gible   From the east of India it is now necessary to turn to the west  and we have there to account for the presence of a non Armeuoid Alpine population of a brachycephalic leptorrhine type which appears indeed in Bengal in the east but is much more marked in the west of India  extending as it does from Baluchistan to Coorg  whence perhaps it has penetrated the extreme south east of the peninsula  Risley explains this type as Turko Iranian in the north  and as ScythoDravidian in the south  but there appears to be no justification  for his distinction  since there seems to be no change in type toward the south which is not explicable by assuming  and with every probabdity  a protc australoid admixture increasing inversely to the degree of latitude  If “ Scythian ” has any precise meaning it must refer to the Saka  who appear to have been a dolichocephalic people probably nearly allied to the Indo Aryans and unable to introduce the brachycephalic element even if they entered India in sufficient numbers  which is highly improbable  The Turki and Tungus invaders on the other hand were of Mongolian affinities and the type of brachycephaly which we are considering does not appear to belong to that family  In any case Crooke  Haddon  Giuffrida Ruggeri and Buxton agree in rejecting Risley’s diagnosis of the western brachycephaly and Chanda has offered a basis for a much more satisfactory hypothesis  He postulates a Tokharian speaking branch of hmno alpinm occupying the Pamirs which also invaded India only to find the middle of the Gangetic plain occupied by Vedic Aryans and therefore pushed round them to give rise to Grierson’s “ outer band ” of Indo European languages  The theory of an invasion of Alpines from the Pamirs as the explanation of west Indian brachycephaly may be unreservedly accepted  Indeed there is no other explanation which meets the facts  It is accepted by Haddon that “ it is evident that there M22CC  e2  \fCHAPTER XII   450   CASTE  TRIBE AXD RACE   has been a mixture with a strong brachycephalic stock  which must have belonged to the Eurasiatic group since there is no trace whatever of Mongolian characters ”  though “ there is no evidence to suggest when this immigration took Sir Aurel Stein’s discovery of this type of Alpine in the region of Lobplace Nor dating from the first centuries A  D  supports the hypothesis  It is not howdate  It appears on ever possible to accept Chanda’s hypothesis as regards the face of it that a much simpler and more satisfactory view would be to regard the brachycephalic stock as preceding the Rigvedic Aryans  We may suppose them to have entered the Indus valley during or after the Mohenjodaro period and to have extended down the west coast of India as far as Coorg forming the physical basis of several of the brachycephalic or mesaticephalic castes of western India Prabhus  Marathas  Kunbis  Billavas  etc   and introducing the brachyThe brachycephals who remained in northcephalic element into the Brahui  ern India will have at a later date been pushed outwards by the Vedic Aryans carrying the roundheaded element eastwards to Bengal down the Ganges Valley  where the Bengali

Evidently ”  he says  “ the introduction of the brachycephals must go back to a pre historic epoch ”  The itahcs are his  Dixon  Racial History of Man  p  265  suggests “ the second or even the third

as a result of the expansion of the IndoEuropean Kassites  who were raiding the Babylonian frontier before the end of the 3rd millenium B  C    though he does not himself associate this movement with the Alpine extension in India  If we assume that these Alpines spoke an Indo European language  of which there is no direct evidence  their distribution will fit in well enough with Grierson’s theory of the “ outer band ” of Indo Aryan languages  but it is an assumption which is not necessary to the hypothesis advanced or necessarily relevant to the question of race  though as Chanda has pointed out  Grierson finds traces of Pisacha dialects  of Pamiri origin  as far south as the Konkan  which supports such an assumption  The Chitrali  Khowar  are brachycephalic and speak an Indo Aryan  Dardic  language  The HunzaNagar seem to be of mixed type  and speak Burushaski  an unclassed language unrelated so far as at present suggested to any recognised group  Khowari has a Burushaski element which Morgenstierne regards as due to contact  Grierson however says  L  S  VIII  ii  6  “ over the whole of Dardistan there is an underThese words are found far from the present habitat layer of Burushaski words  We may infer that the Burushaski language is the original of Burushaski ” indigenous one and that the Pisacha languages are immigrant  possibly acquired by the brachycephalic Alpines through contact with speakers of an Aryan tongue before the pressure of the latter compelled them to migrate southwards  though the Khowari wfith a Sanskritic tongue appear to be more brachycephalic than their neighbours the Hunza Nagars with a Burushaski one  The traditions of the pre Rig  edic wanderings of the Aryans which are recorded in the Avesta  make it probable that the

By a process of exhaustion the hypothesis is reached that this distribution of blood group B must be sought in the brachycephalic Eurasiatic race that seems to have spread from a centre in or near the Pamirs  The Ainu have been regarded by Haddon as an outlier of the Alpine race  and their likeness to the Eussian peasant has frequently been remarked  their blood groups show 32 7 to 38 5 per cent  of B   and Haddon in any case thus describes the range of homo alpinus “ Galcha  Tajik  Wakhi  etc   of Persia  the Pamirs and neighbouring Add to that areas  and extending in a north easterly direction to Manchuria ”  the southward extension to the Deccan suggested by Chanda and the distribution One more item testifies to the soundness of this of B blood group fits well enough  view  The

noticeable to a watchful eye  This type in enough occurs frequently from the standard Alpine stock and appears to off shoot specialised is probably a have arisen in the highlands of south west Asia in the neighbourhood of which isolated communities such as the Druses and the Maronites still retain the old type with marked purity  While typical of Armenia and Anatolia  it is  generally speaking  still to be found sporadically all over S  E  Europe  Asia Minor and Mesopotamia  mingled in varying proportions with the dolichocephalic Mediterranean type  It probably constituted the most important element in the population of Sumer  In a type modified by hybridization  it is common enough in India  but dohs not seem to be confined to any particular caste though perhaps more often noticeable among Brahmans and Banias than among others  and is most common in Dravidian speaking India and in the upland valleys of the This race appears to have been at any rate east Punjab and the United Provinces  partly responsible for the highly developed civilization ot ancient Mesopotamia and Asia Minor and in both areas it has ever^nvhere mingled with the Mediterraoccupation  As we have little

Jenks   psychological article  affinity between India on Russian mentality in TAe  \fABMBNOID   453  to whicli the Mediterranean has contributed the most physically  while the Aimenoid may have contributed more culturally  He is claimed as the principal contributor to the culture of Sumer and of Babylon  but the evidence does not seem to justify so exclusive a claim  On the other hand it seems to have been a blend of the Armenoid with the Mediterranean which produced the ‘‘ prospector ” type associated in western Europe with the early metallic industries and perhaps with megalithic monuments which seem in the Near East to be the result of the interplay of Cycladic and Mesopotamian cultures ” It seems likely that t his type reached India either in association with the Mediterranean or in their footsteps  the latter being the more likely  Although at least one has been discovered at Harappa  no Armenoid skulls appear to have yet been discovered at Mohenjodaro  but the skulls found and preserved from this site are probably all of latish date  and do not necessarily represent the early inhabitants  while some of the stone statues are strongly suggestive of the Armenoid type of head  Thurston figures a typically Armenoid skull at p  xlvi of vol  I of Castes ami Tribes of Smithern India as a Hindu skull and speaks of its character as very familiar among all sorts and conditions in southern India  and the type is well represented in his photograph of a Banajiga     The Mediterranean race appears to be the one that has contributed most to the physical composition of the peoples of India  and perhaps also to its culture  The centre from which it dispersed appears to have been the eastern Mediterranean  but that it reached India at a very early date is to be inferred from the crania found at Nal in Baluchistan  at Sialkot and at Bayana  which link the inhabitants of northern India to the dolichocephalic skulls of similar type found at Kish and at Anau  On the evidence of the Indian skulls Sewell and Guha conclude that “ it would seem probable that the Mediterranean stock had become established in northern India at a period that clearly antedates the civilisation at Nal and along the Indus valley  and the differences that have been shown to exist between the human remains at Anau  Kish and Nal indicate that a sufficient length of time had elapsed for certain local variations to have become evolved and estabhshed ”  Excavation in Bahichistan  p  80    M e may therefore infer that northern India was occupied by Mediterraneans before the Armenoid stock began to mingle with them  and it is possible that they were connected with the Indonesian race  now submerged  which seems to have left patches of speakers of Austroasiatic languages along both sides of the Ganges valley in the course of its migrations  Civilisation  however  appears to have its origins in the Fertile Crescent which skirts the hills north of Mesopotamia from Syria to the Persian Gulf  This area was also occupied at a very early date by people of the same Mediterranean type  whose area of characterisation was on the shores of that sea and whose range in early neolithic times seems to have extended as far as the Indian Archipelago along the southern frmge of the mountains that stretch from Asia Minor to the Himalayas  They appear to have occupied the earliest sites at Susa and at a later date to have been also among the early occupants of Anau north of those mountains and near the Caspian Sea  Sir Aurel Stein’s most recent discoveries in the Zhob valley have yielded stone implements of neohthic type  copper weapons and ornaments and painted pottery closely resembling that from culture strata ascribed to pre Sumerian times in Mesopotamian sites  under conditions indicating prolonged occupation by a homogeneous culture of the sites excavated  Very close similarity is also found with remains from sites in southern Seistan  and there is marked resemblance to material from Mohenjodaro and Harappa  It seems likely  however  that the Fertile Crescent contained from a very early period an admixture of racial types  and it was perhaps as a result of this that civilisation arose there  since “ Rivers has sho^vn that the establishment of contacts between peoples with different training and equipment produces new ideas and liberates initiative ”  and the Sumerians whose civilisation  at any rate in this area if not in the world  is the oldest yet discovered  seem to have been of mixed race and to have included types of both the hypsibrachycephalic Armenoid and the dolichocephalic Mediterranean f ‘  ’  ‘  ’    Peak wid Fleure  Peasants and Potters  page 132   t Peake and Fleure  Peasants and Potters  page 132  suggest also

been demonstrated by the discovery of objects of common type in both areas  and “ lively intercourse between the Sir John Marshall concludes that there was a Indus valley and Elamite and Mesopotamian sites at the end of the fourth millenium B  C ” The Mohenjodaro civilisation occupied according to Marshall the period between 3250 and 2750 B  C  and its connection with Mesopotamia is dated back to its very beginnings  It is assumed by Marshall that it developed in India but failing evidence to that effect it seems a much safer hypothesis that the main features came in from Mesopotamia  to the

of Indoor races which imported or developed this civilisation  Aryan gods do not appear to have begun to encroach on the civilisation of the Fertile Crescent till towards the end of the third miUenium when a period of race movement began  possibly occasioned by cbmatic changes to the north  The Indo European languages were  as we have already seen  preceded in India by both Austric and Dravidian languages and have been influenced by both  but while there is nothing to indicate that the speakers of the Austric languages had any advanced culture we find the Dravidian speakers of to day not only having a culture of very great antiquity  but also one very strongly suggestive of Mesopotamian affinities  while its early megalithic cults surviving all over southern India and sporadically in northern and further India can hardly be considered without reference to the megalithic cultures of the Mediterranean  It is probable that there were direct contacts between southern India and Mesopotamia by sea  but the existence of the Brahui in Baluchistan makes the existence of land contacts equally The Sumerian civilisation at the head of the Persian Gulf seems to have likely  been largely dependent on the cultivation of the date the Sumerians located their Garden of Eden in Dilmun  then also a date bearing land  where is now Bushire on the coastal route to Makran  and the date is still the staple crop in the valleys of the   Iakran coast on the natural route between the ancient parts of Sumeria and the Indus delta  whether the medium of travel be land or sea  Maritime communications were certainly developing during the third millenium B  C  but early ^oyages must have been primarily coasting voyages  On the other hand a migration by a land route from Mesopotamia was probably at one time a matter of much less difficulty than it was found by Alexander’s army  since at one time the whole of that now inhospitable area was undoubtedly fertile country  and apart from the Nal find already mentioned  Sir Aurel Stein’s tour in Gedrosia in 1928 has disclosed scores of sites of ancient habitation yielding pottery  which links them with the earliest Susa zone

remains of enormous dams and bands proving that at one time the land was elaborately irrigated and pointing perhaps to the period at which its natural waters began to fail on account of climatic

Syrian Gypsy  and also the very early connection between the Dravidian and Indo Aryan languages he regards the Dravidian languages of the Deccan as having definitely come southwards from northern India  Evidence is also forthcoming to indicate that Dravidian languages were at one time spoken in Gujarat  while Bloch’s tentative suggestion that Brahui might be immigrant from the south east not only seems  XXV        unhkely on a priori grounds but is rebutted by Morgenstierne in his Report on a Linguistic Mission to N  W  India  Oslo  1932   Rapson remarks that the reason why the Brahui has not been accepted as representing the Dravidian is that the racial character of the Brahui is Iranian and he adds that their tribal system is the antithesis of the caste system  and uses this argument to explain the change of racial character that he believes to have taken place  Haddon  however  says of the Dehwar and the Brahui that “ in all essentials they belong to the dolichomesocephalic series ” and must be regarded as a mixed tyi  e  while Bray reports that the Brahui skuU is deliberately rounded in infancy  though babes are alleged Guha’s opinion is that they were originally dolichoceto be born long headed  phalic but are now mesocephalic verging on brachycephalic as a result of a heavy admixture of Balochi blood  while artificial deformation possibly contributes to their roundness of head  a roundness which he agrees is accompanied by a long face   As for their tribal system  it is true that strangers have been incorporated in considerable numbers  but there exists  in spite of their undoubtedly mixed racial type to day  a very strong preference among the Brahui for endogamy  decidedly suggestive of the caste system  this  and by one authority tKe Mamashahi and the Nichari clans and the Dehwars are specifically reported to be definitely endogamous  and these are the oldest and aboriginal groups  Sir Denis Bray’s report of 1911  shows that the traces of a former matrilineal system are clear enough  and the story recorded by Lieut  Carloss of his visit to the cave dwellings of Gondraniin 1838  J  A  S  B   March 1839   when he was shown the palace of Badul Jamaul  the princess married by the stranger “ a son of the King of Egypt ” who became king of the matrilineal and matrilocal kingdom  is exceedingly suggestive of Mediterranean affinities  while the Shrine of Bibi Nani near Hinglaj  also in Las Bela  is a place of pilgrimage “ celebrated from the Euphrates to the Ganges ” and the resort alike of Muslim and Hindu pilgrims  Sir Thomas Holdich says of it “ the object of their veneration is probably the same goddess who was known to the Chaldeans under the same old world name  Nana  a thousand years before the time of Abraham  Nothing testifies so strongly to the unchangeable nature of the geographical link formed by Makran between East hidden away in the deep folds of the and West than  sic  does this remark able Malan mountains ”  It has already been pointed out  para  156  that the Dravidian language is now being found to have Mesopotamian and Caucasian affinities  and failing evidence to the contrary it is not unreasonable to conclude that the civilisation of the Indus valley was associated with speakers of Dravidian languages of Mediterranean race with an Armenoid admixture and a developed culture derived from the Near East  Indeed the Brahui themselves regard the Mohenjodaro ruins as the work of their own ancestors   though it seems probable that this may be a 7 «a sf tradition acquired from the suggestions of the excavators themselves  Moreover though this culture seems to have disappeared in the Indus valley it seems to have handed on to the later Indo European invaders the pictographs

therefore have occurred in the Ganges basin where the middle kingdom has always been regarded as the true focus of Hindustan and the standard for the rest of Sanskrit India both of language and religion  This is not only what might be expected on a priori grounds but it fits in convincingly both with known facts and with probable hypotheses  Sir John Marshall has pointed out that the latest date for the survival of the Mohenjodaro civilisation is early in the third millenium  and he has taken the jar burials at Harappa as indicative of the arrival of a fresh people with different customs  The practice of fragmented burial in jars appears to have very strong Iranian associations  and the Indus valley is right in the path of the Pisacha migration from the Iranian plateau and the Pamirs to the west coast of India  Here  it seems is the explanation of the break in continuity between the Indus valley civilisation and the We do not know at what date the Dravidian arrival of the Eigvedic Aryans  speakers pushed southwards to occupy the peninsula  but it seems likely that they must have taken a western route and have penetrated south India before the Alpines came in from the Pamirs  Some of the features of south Indian culture suggest not merely Asia Minor  e ^r   the fire walking ceremonies such as are common in south India and formed a feature of the worship of Artemis in Cappadocia  but Crete  where there was a cult of snakesf  which indeed were vehicles of the soul throughout Greece  and worship of the mother goddess  and where the vogue of slender waists for males is very suggestive of mediaeval Indian sculpture  while the popular sport among the Kallar and MaravarJ of jumping onto enraged bulls with sharpened horns to pluck off a cloth put there for the purpose and prove themselves men in the eyes of their women folk is most reminiscent not only of the bull baiting of Provence  where a rosette must be snatched from the points of the horns of an infuriated bull  but also of the bull jumping scenes cm Cretan vases  though in southern India the practice does not extend to somerTerracotta figurines of the mother goddess have been saults nor to

Maurya stratum  indicating the extension of the Indus valley The cult of the bull is common culture to the Ganges Valley and the Madhyadesa  to the early cultures of Crete  of Eg ’p t  of the Near East  of the Indus valley and of Hindu India  Dr  Guha points out that the brachycephahc admixture extends to the Tamilnad but not to the Andhradesa  a conclusion which is substantiated not only by the appearance of the people but also by their character  the Tamil being far the more pragmatical and more sensible of hard facts and economic values  whereas the Telugu has precisely that volatile  artistic and sensitive temperament that one is accustorned to associate with the Mediterranean stock  The Telugu  perhaps the purest Mediterranean stock in India  has in historic times been pushing up north eastwards along the Coromandel Coast  and apparently the thrust of Alpines south east across the Mysore plateau has failed to follow back north eastwards just as it failed to penetrate the high ranges and heavy jungle of the Western Ghats which isolated the Malabar Coast from the brachycephahc influence  If the hypothesis that the civilized inhabitants of the Indus valley were Dra vidian speakers be rejected  the only available alternative seems to be that they spoke some language of the Munda family  This is not impossible  and if the language of ancient Sumer was agglutinative as is Dravidian  so also are the Munda languages  The hypothesis however that the early civilization of India was Dravidian rather than Mimda seems much easier to adopt  though it is still possible that it

themselves speak of Asuras as metal using foreigners  while the    Sanskrit speakers in their turn used the term asum for a race found by them in India  suppose that the language spoken by the Indus valley civilization has totally disappeared  a supposition which seems  to say the least of it  highly improbable in view of the undoubted survivals in the field of religion  and it may here be pointed out that Przyluski  Arcliiv Orientalni IV  2  August 1932  vide Indian Antiquary  Jarmarj 1933  suggests a non IndoEuropean origin for the name of the god Vithnu and a Dravidian origin for the  If both these alternatives be rejected we are forced to  god himself   The early culture of the Mediterraneans and Aimenoids in India may perhaps be most conveniently described as pre Vedic Hinduism  Although this culture disappeared from the Indus valley  it must have survived across the Jamna with sufficient vigour to react to the Kigvedic Aryans whom it probably supplied with a script  and whose religious beliefs it ultimately submerged in its own philosophy  Slater  has aptly pointed out that Krishna himself was of Kaga descent and the traditional blue colour in which Hindu art depicts him possibly represents the brunette colouring of the Mediterranean as distinguished on the one hand from the blond Aryans and on the other from the dusky aborigmals  Slater again points out that Sukra the chief priest of the Asuras is stated by the Mahabharata to have become “ the spiritual guide of both the Daityas and the Devas”  thus recording the success of the prevedic priestly class in imposing their spiritual authority on the Aryans also  and this same S^ra  or another one  according to the Vishnu Purana said mantras for the success of the Asuras and restored to life the Danavas His father was the rishi Bhrigu whose sons were Brahmans and slain by Indra  Clearly there were Brahmans before the Rigvedic Aryans  priests of the Daityas  and we must look for the origin of that caste in the priests of the presuinably Dravidian speaking civilisation who must have been acquainted with the mathematical and astronomical knowledge of contemporary Babylonia  At the same time it does not seem possible that the prevedic Hindu culture can have remained unaffected by the Iranian immigration from the Pamirs  which probably displaced It seems that while the greater it in the Indus valley during the 3rd millenium B C number migrated towards southern India by a western route  enough must have penetrated the Ganges valley to affect the physical features of a portion at any rate of the population  It is significant that the degree of brachycephaly in the Bengali castes decreases from Brahman downwards if we except the mongoloid groups like the Maghs f We have also seen that enough of the prevedic civilisation remained to have a very definite and lasting influence on the religion and culture The Alpine peoples have generally evinced a disof the Rigvedic Aryans  position for peaceful penetration rather than warlike domination and we may conclude that the irruption of the Pamiri invaders was less violent than that of their successors in the second millenium  and their settlements must have been rural rather than urban  in contrast to the Mediterranean  Armenoid culture  In fact the bulk of the descendants of the Alpine invaders are probably to be foimd in the great cultivating castes of Kunbis  Kurmis and Kapus representing the Tajiks of Iran  vide Keane  Man Past and Present  1920  page 542   and it is worth notice that one of the Tajik tribes is spoken of as “ Purmuli or Fermuli ” mutate p  for hw and then k  a philological process familiar enough  and the result is something very near Kurmi ’  The prevedic Mediterraneans probably had a matrilineal system which would have facilitated the amalgamation of the Alpines  but it generally happens that people with such a system tend to substitute a patrilineal one where the two come into contact  and it is likely that the change from a matrilineal to a patrilineal system started to take place in upper India as a result of the Pamiri immigration  while it is not unlikely that the same process tended to substitute the worship of male for female deities  The process of Hinduising the female village deities of southern India by providing them with orthodox male husbands from the In Madura the fisheyed goddess official Hindu pantheon is still perhaps in process  Minakshi is annually so married with great pomp and eclat  but in the Villages the goddess is still the real deity and protectress of the people rather than the recognised Hindu gods  So also in Bengal the Dharma puja paddhati records that Aclva  the mother of the gods  was married to Shiva with “ traditional ceremonies not enjoined

the Punjab  “ whose heirs are their sisters  childWith the exception of the Nambudris  who follow the Rigveda  ren not their own Brahmans in southern India  many of whom at any rate follow the

code ” is clearly a survival of a matrilineal system orthodoxy would appear to enjoin the patrilineal prohibition of such marriages  The Pandyan dj nasty seems to have been originally matrUineal as Tamil poems are said to allude to its founder as a woman  and the tradition recorded by Megasthenes is that it was founded by a daughter of Heracles  while Pliny describes the Indian people “ gens Pandce  sola Indorum regnata foeminis ”  The worship of goddesses in whose honour annual fairs are held  is more important in the Himalayas of the Punjab and United Provinces than that of the orthodox gods  and such goddesses  though now regarded as incarnations of Devi  are frequently associated with the worship of snakes  while it seems likely that the Nanagotri Brahmans of TehriGarhwal represent families which originally traced their descent through the female It is possible that the Pisacha variety of the Indoline  »rt ia  mother s brother   European tongue was introduced at the same time as the Eurasiatic Alpine stock from the Pamirs  and either passed on to the Rigvedic Aryans the peculiarities it retained from the Dra vidian it replaced  or never completely displaced its predecessor as the prevailing vernacular  An alternative hypothesis might be that the Pamiri stock did not ci o s s the Jamna but migrated eastwards down its right bank thus leaving more or les s intact the prevedic

the penetratior  of the Alpine element was much more limited in the east than in the west and that in the former at any rate it did not obliterate the pre existing culture              This prevedic

invaders  near cousins of the Kassites who about the same time overthrew the rulers of Babylon and established themselves as lords of Mitaimi  occupied the Punjab about the middle of the 2ud millenium B C   Their previous traditions as gleaned from the Avesta are conveniently summarised by Peake and Fleure  Merdtant Venturers in Bronze  page 130      Driven from their northern home on account of

divided one part going to Haroyu  Herat  and the other probably to Kabul and thence to the Punjab at a date not later than 1400 B  C  and probably a century or so earlier  Their occupation of the country between the Indus and the Jamna  where the Rigveda seems to have been composed  but not written  must have taken the form of migratory movement and was probablv effected without much difficulty  The description of their enemies as “ noseless’’ suggests conflict v  ith tribes of proto au straloid affinities  and there seems every probability that tribes such as the Bhils and the Chodhras would have continued to occupy hill and forest areas in spite of the Mediterranean and Alpine migrations  If the prevedic civulisation in the Indus valley had really declined  this may have enabled such tribes to re occupy parts of the open country  The mention however  e g   in the civih liymn of the first book of the Rigveda  of the cities  castles and great wealth of an enemy whose vyomenfolk bathed themselves in milk  suggests that the ancient civilisation was far from being extinct  and it is not impossible but that many aborigines were employed as servants and as auxiliary troops or as allies against the invader  a practice which was common enough in mediaeval India  The development of a  v ritten literature cieaily took place at the second stage of their mvasion described by Rapson as a colonising stage in contrast to that of mass migration  It is  \fARYAN   459  just at such a stage that amalgamation with the pre existing inhabitants is most likely  and the influence of the latter can clearly be traced in the change in vedic religion  which appears even in the tenth book of the Rigveda  and in the Yajurveda  as well as in the Atharvaveda  for this last consists  principally at any rate  of magic while the pantheistic philosophy later developed in the Upanishads is already apparent Pargiter points out that though the name of in the tenth book of the Rigveda  the compiler of the Rigveda was well known to the later epic and pauranic tradition  the very mention of Vyasa is ignored or suppressed in Vedic literature  It is possible to infer from this that the immediate post Rigvedic brahmans may have been the inheritors of the prevedic tradition which was adverse to the Rigveda and supported the indigenous deities by preference  It is possible that the contest between Vasistha and Viswamitra  as a result oi which the Kshattriya became a Brahman  may symbolise the amalgamation of the two cultures  and Viswamitra’s formal renunciation of Kshattriya ways the final ascendancy of the pre Aryan In any case it is more than probable that the post Rigvedic literature  in religion  which the 10th book of the Rigveda must be included  would contain importations from pre Rigvedic indigenous tradition  while the cerebral letters acquired by the Indo Aryan from the indigenous languages “ play an increasingly important part in the development of Indo Aryan in its subsequent phases ”  just as the use of rice and the areca nut  equally of pre Aryan origin  have aflected the subsequent developments on the cultural side  The development of the art of writing from the prevedic pictographs must have gone on simultaneously and was  as suggested by Macdonell  no doubt first used for purely secular purposes and was not at first regarded as proper for application to religious hymns and lormulae  This would seals which fit in well with its derivation from the signs on the Mohenjodaro seem to have been primarily used for commerce  as cotton fabric bearing a seal impressed with an Indus valley stamp has been recovered from a prehistoric site It seems unlikely in the extreme that the language  religion and culture iij liaq  of the invaders could have been influenced by the pre existing civilisation witliout an admixture of race takmg place  and the ract that later tradition and literature definitely describes some of the rishis and their descendants as non  Aryan  indicates  that this admixture extended to the priesthood  as it probably did to all otner Thus the legends of the origin of the Baidhyas of Bengal

hand the Brahman in the Rigveda seems to have been second in social importance to the Rajanya and it seems not impossible that traditions of the conflict between the Brahmans and the Kshattriyas and the extermination of the latter by Parasurama  represent a revolt against the Aryan aristocracy led by a priestly class of mixed origin  whicn would naturally have the support In the United Provinces

is not suggested that the above views are the final word on race in India  but it is submitted that the hypotheses put forward do offer a scheme into which the fact at present known will fit wdthout distortion  and it will perhaps be convenient at The earliest occupants of India were probably this point briefly to recapitulate  of the Xegrito race  but they have left little trace on the mainland of the peninsula  The Protoaustraloids who followed them and whose origin must be sought in Palestine  where up to the present the earliest ancestors of their race have been found   may claim to be the true aborigines on the ground that their racial type was ultimately fixed in India  They were followed by an early branch probably of the Mediterranean race  speaking an agglutinative tongue from which the present Austroasiatic languages are derived  which migrated down the Ganges valley mingling no doubt with the Protoaustraloids and in the van at any rate penetrating to the farthest south east of the Asiatic continent  This early branch of the Mediterranean race may have carried with it the beginnings of culture with a rudimentary knowledge of agriculture  They may also have taken the practice of erecting rude stone monuments and perhaps of primitive navigation  This migration was followed by a later immigration of civilised Mediterraneans from the Persian Gulf  but ultimately from eastern Europe  who brought with them the knowledge of metals but not of iron and were followed by later waves of immigrants and a generally advanced culture  which maintained a connection with the cities of Mesopotamia and cvoh ed or developed the prehistoric civilisation of the Indus valley and in all probability a similar civilisation in the Ganges valley  All these imnugrants were of the dolichocephalic type  but mixed with this last race  possibly even with the first comers but in any case as later settlers  was a brachycephalic element coming ultimately from the Anatolian plateau in the form of the Armenoid branch of the Alpine race  The civilisation which arose in India under the auspices of these races had developed by the end of the 4th millenium B  C  a high standard of comfort  art and sanitation in city life  and a religion which bears many resemblances to the earlier religions of the eastern Mediterranean  The language in use was probably Dravidian  and there was a pictographic script analogous to those in use in prehistoric Mesopotamia  This civilisation was flooded in the west during the third millenium B  C  by an immigration from the Iranian plateau and the Pamirs of a brachycephalic race speaking perhaps an Indo European language of the Pisacha or Dardic family  the main course of which migration went down the west of India and across the Mysore plateau to the south  missing the Malabar coast which has thus preserved much of the ancient civilisation of Dravidian speaking India  Another branch of these immigrants fewer in number penetrated the Ganges valley but was not strong enough to obliterate the Armenoid Mediterranean civilisation  though it probably modified Meanwhile in the extreme east of India other movements were it a good deal  on  there was a widespread race movement of the southern Mongoloids going as southwards to the Bay of Bengal and into Indonesia  which had some reflex influence on India from the east  Finally about 1500 B  C  came the Indo Aryan migration into the Punjab  which first occupied the area between the Indus and the Jamna and later sent colonies across the Jamna into Hindustan  These imposed themselves upon the surviving civilisation there  which so reacted to this powerful stimulant as to produce from the combined material the philosophy  religon  art and letters that were the glory of ancient India  though it yet remains for the descendants of those early races to accomplish the vision of the Bhavishya Purana and unite the peoples of India in the fulness of time to be of one caste

hitherto known as “ depressed ” was originally suggested by the Census Superintendent for Assam and has been adopted in this report as the most satisfactory alternative to the unfortunate and depressing label “ depressed class It has been criticised as being the same term as ‘ outcaste ’ only of five instead of two syllables  and it must be admitted that exterior is but old ‘ out ’ writ large  At the same time it is here submitted that outcaste  with an e  has not unnaturally attracted to its connotation the implications of the quite differently derived outcast  with no c  Outcaste correctly interpreted seems to mean no more than one who is outside the caste system and is therefore not admitted to Hindu society  but since in practice the exterior castes also contained those who had been cast out from the Hindu social body for some breach of caste rules ‘ outcaste and outcast were in some cases synonymous and the derogatory implications of obliquity attaching to the latter term have unjustly coloured the former  a taint which is not conveyed by the substitution of the word exterior ’  which may connote exclusion but not extrusion  ‘  ’  ’  ‘  ’  ‘  ^^he instructions of the Government of India for the taking of this census concluded with the following enjoinder     “ The Government of India also desire that attention should be paid to the collection of  information conducive to a better knowledge of the backward and depressed classes and of the problem involved in their present and future welfare ”  In that connection the following mstructions were issued to the various Superintendents of Census Operations in India     “ For this purpose it will be necessary to have a list of castes to be included in depressed  and all provinces are asked to frame a list apphcable to the province  There are very great difficulties in framing a list of this ffind and there are insuperable difficulties in framing a list of depressed classes which will be apphcable to India as a whole ”  classes  A subsequent instruction ran as follows     “ I have explained depressed castes as castes  contact with whom entails purification on the part of high caste Hindus  It is not intended that the term should have  any reference to occupation as such but to those castes which bv reason of their traditional position in Hindu society are denied access to temples  for instance  or have to use separate wells or are not allowed to sit inside a school house but have to remain outside or which suffer similar social disabilities  These disabilities vary in different parts of India being much more severe in the south At the same time the castes which belong to this class are of India than elsewhere  generally known and can in most parts of India be listed for a definite area though perhaps the lists for India as a whole will not coincide ”  The question of the preparation of fists for each pro% ince was discussed at a meeting of the Superintendents of Census Operations in January 1931 before the census took place  It was agreed that each province should make a fist of castes who suffered disability on account of No their low social position and on account of being debarred from temples  schools or wells  no more precise instructions were specific definition of depressed castes was framed and issued to the Superintendents of Census Operations  because it was realised that conditions varied so much from province to province and from district to district  even  within some provinces  that it would be unwise to tie down the Superintendents of Census Operations with too meticulous instructions  The general method of proceeding prescribed was that of local enquiry into what castes were held to be depressed and whv and the framing of a fist accordingly  “ depressed It was decided that Muslims and Christians should be excluded from the term ” tribes  who hill and forest had not become Hindu but whose speaking  generally that  class and religion was returned as Tribal  should also be excluded and in the numbers of the exterior castes given below these principles have been followed^ A note on the depressed and backward classes in Assam submitted to the Franchise Committee by the Superintendent of Census Operations for that province affords a very clear example of the way in which these principles were intended to be applied and have been applied by Superintendents of Census Operations  and an extract from it is given towards the end of this appendix  471  \fAPPENDIX 1   472   Both for social and political reasons it is obviously necessary to know the number of these whole but also indifferent provinces  The matter is of importance not only with reference to their representation in the body pohtic  but also with reference to any social work that is to be done towards raising them from their present backward position to one more nearly comparable with that of more advanced social groups ^  classes not only in India as a  The Census Commissioner in 1921  Census of India  Volume I  part I  paragraph 193  gave what he describes as minimum numbers of the Depressed Classes in various provinces  naaking a total of 52 680 000  This figure he states  must be taken as a low estimate  since it does not include aU those who should have been included  and he says  “We may confidently place the numbers of these Depressed Classes all of whom are considered impure  at something between 55 and 60 milhons in India proper”  Of the 52J million for which the Census Commissioner gave actual figures  less than 43 J million were to be found in British India  This figure agrees fairly well with the 42 milhon odd given as the figure of Depressed Classes by the Franchise Committee of 1919  It is also not greatly at variance with the 44 J million estimated by the Nair Central Committee of 1929 as the figure of Depressed Classes in British India  but it varies very considerably from the Hartog Committee’s figure of approximately 30 million  Clearly it is time that some more definite figures were obtained than the estimates hitherto employed  There are however a considerable number of difficulties in arriving at a determined figure   The definition to be used in arriving at the figure of Depressed Classes is a very difficult The following possible tests are to be considered  matter       1   Whether the caste or class in question can be served by clean Brahmans or not    2   Whether the caste or class in question can be served by the barbers   water carriers   tailors  etc   who serve the caste Hindus   3   Whether the caste in question  pollutes  a  high  caste  Hindu by contact or by  proximity   4   Whether the caste or class in question is one from whose hands a caste Hindu can take water    5  Whether the caste or class in question is debarred from using public conveniences   such as  roads  ferries  wells or schools   6   7   Whether the caste or class in question is debarred from the use of Hindu temples  Whether in ordinary social intercourse a well educated member of the caste or class in question will be treated as an equal by high caste men of the same educational qualifications    8   Whether the caste or class in question is merely depressed on account of its own ignorance  illiteracy or poverty and but for that would be subject to no social disability    9   Whether it is depressed on account of the occupation followed and whether but for that occupation it would be subject to no social disability   Now it is obvious that several of these tests themselves involve an unknown factor  What is a  clean Brahman 1  adjectives  What is the line between a high caste and a low caste Hindu  since both What constitutes  may and ordinarily would have a merely comparative sense    pollution or what constitutes the right to use a temple  since here again there are grades from who must remain entirely outside and not approach a temple at all to those who are  those  admitted to the inner sanctuary   In deciding what is an Exterior Caste  none of these tests can be taken alone  From the point of view of the State the important test is the right to use public conveniences roads  wells and schools  and if this be taken as the primary test  religious disabilities and the social difficulties indirectly involved by them may be regarded as contributory only  Some importance must be attached to them  since obviously if the general public regards the persons of certain groups as so distasteful that concerted action is resorted to in order to keep them away  persons of those groups do suffer under a serious disabihty  It is not enough to say that a road is a public road  and that if A considers himself polluted by the presence of B at a distance of 30 yards and no compulsion rests on B to remove Mmself from the road to let A pass  the disability is A’s and not B’s  since A must leave the road or be polluted  That is all very well if B and his friends are in such a position as to be able to impose on A the If  however  it is possible for A and his friends position of being one to leave the road  by     boycotting B and his friends for certain purposes to bring pressure on B to di3 ^gard his legal rights and to conform to A’s religious prejudices and leave the road whenever A is seen at a distance clearly B has in practice no freedom of action in the matter of the road whether his religious This question of the use of roads has been taken as an illustration scruples are involved or not  but in point of fact the restriction of the use of roads is one which seems to be generally disappearing and has possibly disappeared to such an extent that the question may be ignored as The use of wells  however  is another matter and the far as British India is concerned  disability of the exterior castes varies from not being allowed to approach the village well at all  \fEXTEEIOR CASTES   473  to the position common in Bengal in which persons of certain castes may not draw water themselves hut must await someone of a clean caste who draws water for them at the well  The  question of schools is another very real problem for the exterior castes  since in many parts of India if they sit inside the school they would be made to suffer in some other way by the higher castes using the school  and whereas the acquisition of reading and writing at least may be taken for granted in the case of the children of any Brahman  and of other castes as well  it is an exception in the case of the exterior castes  the presence of whose children is disliked in the school by their social superiors and whose children  if they read at all  must sit outside in the sun and dust   argued that untouchability is merely dependent on the occupation  so that an untouchable person or caste abandoning an unclean occupation becomes touchable  This may be true in a literal sense  but it is not true morally  since members of exterior cast^^es who It is often  may have abandoned their traditional calling for two or three generations are  still  liable  to be treated as outside the pale of decent society  and their presence is apt to be regarded as an offence by members of interior castes  while they would not be ordinarily admitted to social functions on a footing of equality   For purposes therefore of deciding what persons are to be included in the numbers of the exterior castes it has been necessary for each promnce to deal with the problem in its own way  and to produce its own list  It is not possible to say generally that such and such a caste is It may be possible to exterior to Hindu society and to apply that dictum to the whole of India  do so in the case of certain castes  such as those of Dom and Bhangi  but it certainly is not the case that a caste which is depressed in one part of India is depressed everywhere  Consequently each provincial superintendent has had to draw up his own list  taking into account the various factors enumerated above  and to reckon as depressed only those castes or classes who definitely suffer from serious social and political handicap on account of their degraded position in the Hindu social scheme  So much is this the position that  in the Central Provinces for instance  the castes to be treated as depressed for purposes of figures in this Report have varied from district to district and no list is possible at all which is applicable to the whole of the province for all the castes concerned  Many castes and tribes who would be included by some  at any rate  of the tests mentioned above have been excluded from the list on the ground that they suffer no tangible disability as a result of their inferiority in the Hindu system   Many primitive tribes for instance  Such tribes when are in an ambiguous position by reason of their not really being Hindus at all  they come within the Hindu system often become automatically depressed  largely on account of the fact that they have no prejudices against occupations and food which are taboo to interior Hindus  On the other hand  the socially superior individuals of these identical tribes are very frequently able to get themselves incorporated into the Hindu system as Rajputs or Kshattriyas  though their fellow tribesmen may remain exterior  In some cases  however  a complete tribe has succeeded in establishing its claim to a more or less equivocal twice born status  In these circumstances  therefore  non Hinduised hill and forest tribes have been excluded from the total of the Exterior Castes  as until they reach the stage of incorporation in regular Hindu society  they do not really suffer by their potential position in that scheme  Similarly criminal tribes have not been included unless their condition be such that even if they ceased to be criminal by habit or profession and lived as peaceable and law abiding citizens  they would still be depressed on account of their social position as distinct from their occupational stigma  Again there are numbers of castes who  though they are regarded by interior Hindus as ceremonially polluting and such as from whose hands water cannot be taken  have in many cases such strong caste organisations and include so many individuals of substance and education that they have built up for themselves a strong position which obviates the need of any special measures It is these considerations which have caused for their social  political or religious protection  the Census Superintendent of Cochin State to exclude the Iruvans from the number of those depressed  while the Shahas  Telis and Mahishyas of Bengal and Assam would themselves protest at any such inclusion   The note on the Depressed and Backward Classes in Assam by the Census Superintendent Assam Census Report  affords an excellent example of the facts and considerations taken into account in determining what constitutes a depressed caste  In the case of Assam the numbers of the exterior castes are so high in comparison to the total nmnber of interior Hindus or rather the number of interior Hindus is so comparatively small in a province in which the numbers of backward classes and hill tribes is high  that the disabilities attaching to depres sion are slight compared to those in most provinces  but the factors to be taken into account are the same everywhere  The nonHindus and the hill and forest tribes included by the Assam Census Superintendent as Backward Classes have been excluded from the figures given in the table below which amount for all India for that province  which forms an appendix to the  to just a littk over fifty million   These figures are given province by promnce in this place tables in a somewhat different form will be found towards the end of this appendix  The total number of exterior castes in British India appears in Table XVH as 39 137 405  the difference being due to the fact that in two provinces the figures in Provincial Table II on which that table is based differ slightly from the figures obtained from the caste table for individual castes     \f                    «  APPENDIX 1   474

they have not already become so  Of the others not so marked some are admittedly doubtful and their inclusion as exterior castes might be justified others on the contrary appear to me to be such that

both of which the details do not tally precisely wi th those given for the whole pro^     j  I     I  j  Vince   These then being the numbers of the depressed classes in India some estimate is necessary of their position at the piesent time  and it has already been pointed out that their disabilities can be roughly divided into two categories  Firstly  that under which they are barred from public utihties  such as  the use of roads and tanks  and secondly  their religious disabilities which debar them from the use of temples  burning grounds  mats and some other institutions  In addition to the above  but arising out of the second of these  there are the disabilities involved in relation with private individuals  such as the services of barbers and the admission to tea shops  hotels or theatres owned by private individuals  A resolution of the Anti Untouchability Conference of 1929 in Madras regretted “ to note that in Eestaurants  Cofiee Hotels  Hair Dressing Saloons  Water Pandals  etc   notices are hung prominently excluding the untouchables”  and the Census Superintendent for the Central Provinces writes “The fact that a sw eeper may sit beside a high class Hindu in a railway carriage or a motor lorry without any question of his right to do so has not yet made it any more easy in the interior for a touring ofiicer to persuade cartmen of some castes to carry his sweeper from camp to camp  In fact in certain districts it is always essential to employ at least one cartman of humble caste for this purpose ”  Theoretically perhaps the admission to Hindu temples would be enough  once it is conceded  to remove all the other disabihties  for the tem ple is not  merely a religious institution but is also in many ways a social one  for the term must be taken to include such buildings as namgarhs which  as temples do in some parts of India  serve as a village hall or a town hall for the pubhc generally  A temple also contains a school  so that the absence of the right of entering the temple may debar an individual from the possibihiy of attending the school  In some Hindu temples  such as the Parbati Temple in Poona  the Kalarama Temple at Nasik  the Hajo Temple in Assam  it has been in the past the practice to admit non Hindus  such as Christians and Muslims to a point to which the untouchable Hindus were never admitted at all  It is  however not quite certain how far under present conditions the actual right of admission to a temple would  if conceded  remove the social disabilities of the depressed castes since it  \fEXTERIOR CASTES   483  might have the efEect of merely driving the higher castes to shun the temples to which the untouchables were admitted  In any case the right varies much in different places  An Iruva or a Thiyya in Malabar must stay 325 feet from the curtain wall of the temple of Guruvayur  Yet the Iruva for instance  and this wall is 350 feet square with the temple in the centre  have not been treated  in Cochin State at any rate  as a depressed caste at all  since though deprived there likewise of temple entry they are otherwise well to do and not ill educated   As regards the civil rather than the rebgious disabilities to which the depressed classes are subjected  the first one mentioned above is the right to use the public roads up present at to how recently the use of public roads has been debarred in certain cases may be gathered from the fact that the untouchables of Travancore made an organised attempt in 1924 to obtain    the use of roads which skirted the temple at Vaikom  These roads were pubhc roads  maintained by the State for the use of everybody  but on account of their proximity to the temple building  the untouchables were not allowed to use certain sections which skirted the temple too closely  Ultimately  as a result of satyagraha  the temple compound was enlarged and the  ban on the roads was removed  the roads having been realigned so that their users were no longer within the polluting distance of the temple  In 1926 and again in 1930  a similar case occurred in Travancore in connection with Sachindram Temple which is one of the richest Here again the depressed classes wanted the right to use a road maintained by in the State  pubhc funds and belonging to the State  In the matter of the use of roads generally  however  the depressed castes are no longer in the position in which some of them were when the Mangalore District Gazetteer was written  when the Ande Koragas had to carry a spittoon round their necks as being so highly polluting that they could not be allowed to expectorate on the pubhc road  though it has recently been reported that a caste has been found in the Tamilnad  the very sight of which is polluting  so that its unfortunate members are compelled to follow nocturnal habits  leaving their dens after dark and scuttling home at the false dawn The Hindu of December 24th  1932  writes of them like the badger  hyaena or aard vark  “ In this  Tinnevelly  district there is a class of unseeables called Purada Vannans  as follows They are not aUowed to come out during day time because their sight is considered to be Some of these people  who wash the clothes of other exterior castes  working pollution ” between midnight and daybreak  were with difficulty persuaded to leave their houses to interview Mr  A  V  Thakkar  who described them as coming only after repeated persuasion and then with “ their whole bodies shaking and trembling”        The case of wells has abeady been alluded to  and is a far more widespread and real grievance than any which may still survive in regard to the use of roads  Generally speaking  U the exterior castes have succeeded in asserting their right to use public wells  the higher have given them up  Here again the difificulty about the use of wells will be found to be most prevalent in the drier parts of India where water is scarce  In Assam this difficulty is not worth mentioning and in Bengal where it exists  it is usually got over by water being drawn for the exterior castes by some interior caste Hindu  This arrangement is obviously open to certain drawbacks but it is not so serious as the custom in many parts of upper India and southern India which prohibits the exterior castes from having water at all from the well which is used by interior Hindus  The same applies to the use of dharamshalas and of public burning ghats and the burial grounds in regard to all of which the position of the exterior castes is much the same as it is in regard to the use of wells   castes  With regard to schools   the Director of Public Instruction for Bombay reporting for the year 1928 29  remarks that admission to schools was not refused to the children of the depressed classes in the schools under the control of any local body except the District Local Board at Ratnagiri  some schools of the District Local Board of the Nasik District and in the Ahmadabad and Surat districts  In the latter districts the students generally used to sit in temples  dharamshalas or private houses and the pupils of the depressed classes were objected to  but the objection was withdrawn on being warned that such schools would loose any grants that they enjoyed from the Government  How far this withdrawal of objection was effective is doubtful  since at any rate in one case the depressed classes at Surat had to withdraw their children from the school as a result of the indirect pressure exerted on them by higher castes  Similarly in some cases the depressed caste pupils find it better to sit outside the school  Thus at Kaira in as if they sit inside they are boycotted and compelled to leave the school  April 193  some Dheds took their seats with other Hindu boys in the municipal school  Kaira had been one of the centres of Mr  Gandhi’s activities and no objection was raised on that day  but when the parents of the interior caste boys heard of it they threatened a boycott of the school and of the teacher if the Dhed boys were allowed to sit with theirs  or even to occupy the same class room  with the result that the next day the Dheds were refused admission to the school premises  On the other hand in Sind and in the central and southern divisions of Bombay it was reported that there were no primary schools managed by the local authorities which refused admission to the depressed castes’ children  Similarly in Assam no inconvenience appears to have been experienced by the exterior castes in the matter of school attendance  On the other hand in many parts of India the inconvenience is greater than it is in Bombay   M22CC  Very few of the exterior castes attend schools nominally accessible ro them in  \f   APPENDIX I   484  Negapatam  Kumbakonam  Tinnevelly  Cocanada  Bezwada and Narsapur and other towns in southern India  though in Madras  Madura  Sivaganga and some other towns a number of exterior castes’ children attend schools  which are not especially reserved for them and which are not boycotted by the higher castes  In most parts of southern India it is necessary to have special schools for the exterior castes  since it is not yet possible to induce the higher castes to  In July 1931  when it was decided to admit exterior castes into all the aided schools  a number of schools had to close and from some other schools the higher caste children were withdrawn  Similarly in Baroda State the abolition of separate schools in learn  in their company   November 1931  is reported to have given great resentment to the caste Hindus who in some cases withdrew their children from schools and in others destroyed the crops of the In Bengal the Rural exterior castes or poured kerosene oil into the wells used by them  Primary Education Bill passed in 1930  appears to have been opposed by members representing the caste Hindus  and it is alleged that this opposition was aimed at depriving the non caste Hindus and also the poorer Muslims from the benefits of hteracy  In Cochin State on the other hand much has been done to open all educational institutions to the exterior castes though this has involved in some cases the removal of the school to another site  while cases have occurred of some ill treatment of the castes now admitted to the schools  Generally speaking  however  during the last decade the exterior castes at school in Cochin have increased in number from some 1  500 to some 14 000 and out of 700 recognised schools only 3 are stiU reserved to the higher castes  and a Protector of the backward and depressed classes has recently been appointed  Cochin  however  is probably in many ways exceptional   In regard to the matter of the right to enter Hindu temples  the exterior castes were advised by Mr  Gandhi not to attempt to gain entry by his own method of satyagraha as God A temple  however  as has been pointed out  is more than a purely resided in their breasts  religious institution and the right of temple entry is by some regarded as the key position with regard to the removal of untouchability  The claim to enter temples is not opposed only even Justice  the organ of the anti Brahman Party  writes as follows   by high caste Hindus        “For many centuries these peoples  most of whom until recently were Animists  were content to worship at their own shrines  and to try to force themselves into Hindu temples is not to make themselves popular  Nor can we think that any grave  wrong  is done by their continued exclusion they would improving their own condition than in a violent attempt to assert rights which no one had heard of till a few years ago ”  be better occupied in  There is on the other hand a definite movement among many more advanced Hindus to remove the ban on the temple entry  a movement which has since the census been given much impetus by Mr  Gandhi’s fast and the negotiations following it for the admission of untouchables to Hindu temples generally  and it may be mentioned as an instance of this that 8 temples of a Telugu community in Bombay were reported to have been opened to untouchables On the other hand recent cases of attempts to obtain entry by depressed in February 1930  Some 2 000 untouchables collected outside the Kala Ram temple castes have led to violence  at Nasik on March 3rd  1930  and a meeting which attempted to bring about a settlement was stoned by the orthodox  Ultimately some 150 000 Mahars and Chamars were reported to have collected at Nasik and the temple had to be closed for about a month to keep them from entering it  The admission of caste Hindus by a private passage ended in violence in which the orthodox were the aggressors  and which was extended to Mahar villages in the neighbourhood where the depressed castes were violently attacked by caste Hindus  their wells polluted and in some cases their houses burned  A similar attempt to force an entrance a year later had similar results  and in December 1931 the same sort of situation arose on an attempt of the depressed castes to bathe in the Ramakund  the sacred pool at Nasik  and again in Similarly at Singanallur in south India the question of April over the dragging of the rath  entry to a temple led to a free fight in 1930  and at some other places also  In Nagpur a temple was voluntarily opened to untouchables and in the Dacca Division in Bengal a satyagraha of 9 mdnths duration ended in the temple doors being forced open by a band of high caste women who sympathised with the satyagrahis  This was in May  but it was reported in October that the temple was deserted by high caste Hindus  One wonders therefore how far the higher castes are likely to make use of a pan Hindu temple recently endowed at Ratnagiri with a view to providing a common place of worship for all castes   The prohibition against exterior castes entering the Hindu temples naturally raises the question whether they can really be called Hindu at all  Generally speaking  the answer must be that they are de^tely Hindus   they worship the same deities and  though refused entry to the temples  boxes are placed outside  at the limits to which they can approach  to receive The degree of Hinduism does  however  vary considerably thus the Mahars their offerings  and Chamars in general are very decidedly Hindu  whereas the Chuhra of the Punjab is very doubtfully so  taking a Hindu tone when living by a Hindu village  a Muslim tone in a Muslim village and that of a Sikh in a Sikh village   perhaps the Chuhra should really be described as tribal by rehgion  and the possibly connected Chodhra of the Bombay Presidency is definitely regarded as a forest tribe rather than a caste  In any case  in the Pimjab the question has been    \f            EXTERIOR CASTES   485  partly solved at this census by the Chuhra returning himself as an Ad DJianni  that is to say a follower of the original religion  For him it means the customs immemorially obterved by his caste or tribe  but of course the term might mean very different things to different peoples  In the Pvmjab its use as distinct from Hindu  in other provinces the exterior castes have frequently returned themselves as Adi Hindu  Adi Dravida  etc   with a similar implication to that of Ad Dharmi  is probably a political expedient in order to obtain more effective representation on the provincial legislative body  and in spite of the occasional use of the word ‘ Hindu with reference to caste Hindus and excluding the exterior castes it must be held that these castes generally are Hindu by religion even if they are not Hindu socially  hence the expression “ exterior caste ” is suitably applied to castes who follow the Hindu religion but are not admitted to Hindu society  ’  This social bar tends to foster conversion to the Sikh faith  to Islam  or to Chri  tianity  though even after conversion the social stigma does not vanish at once  This is hardly to be expected  The Mazhbi Sikhs are looked down upon by the Sikhs who are not Hazhbi  The Southern Indian Christians distinguish between the castes of their converts in their seating accommodation in churches  and the dislike ot the exterior castes does not immediately disappear when they turn Muslim  At the same time once they are converted it does not take them very long before they can rise in the social scale  and in the case of Indian Christians in southern India a period of about three generations often  perhaps usually  sees them accepted as the equal of pre ’ious converts of most castes   There are other points in which the exterior castes suffer socially  Thus exception is taken to their wearing the ornaments usually worn by higher castes  and in some cases they are not allowed to wear gold ornaments at all  Cases are on record in which Chamars for instance have been beaten for dressing like Rajputs  and the mounting of an exterior caste bridegroom upon a horse for his bridal procession has led to a boycott of the caste in question by the higher caste neighbours  In December 1930 the Kallar in Ramnad propounded eight violence by the Kallar against the e  terior huts were fired  whose granaries and property were destroyed and whose These eight prohibitions were as follows livestock was looted  prohibitions  the disregard of  which led to the use of  castes whose     “  i  that the Adi Dravidas shall not wear ornament of gold and silver  males should not be allowed to wear their clothes above the hips   w  that the     below their knees or   in  that their males should not wear coats or shirts or banivans  iv   no Adi Dravida shall be allowed to have his hair cropped   v   that the Adi Dravidas should not use other than earthenware vessels in their homes   vi    vii   viii         their women shall not be allowed to cover the upper portion of their bodies by clothes or ravukais or thavanies   their women shall not be allowed to use flowers or saffron paste  the men shall not use umbrellas for protection against they wear sandals ”   sun     and  and rain nor should  In June 1931  the eight prohibitions not having been satisfactorily observed by the exterior castes in question  the Kallar met together and framed eleven prohibitions  which went still further than’the original eight  and an attempt to enforce these led to more violence  These eleven prohibitions were    “ 1   The Adi Dravidas and Devendrakula Vellalars should not wear clothes below their  knees  2   The men and women of the above said depressed classes should not wear gold jewels   3  Their vmmen should carry water only in mud pots and not in copper or brass vessels  They should use straw only to carry the water pots and no cloths should be used for that  purpose  4   Their children should not read and  5   The children should be asked only to tend the cattle of the Mirasdars   6   Their  get themselves literate or educated   men and women should work as slaves of the  Mirasdars in their  respective  Pannais  7   They should not cultivate the land either on icaram or lease from the Mirasdars   They must sell away their own lands to Mirasdars of the village at very cheap rates  and if they don’t do so  no water will be allowed to them to irrigate their lands  Even if something is grown by the help of rain water  the crops should be robbed away  when they are 8   ripe  for  harshest   They must work as coolies from 7 a m  to 6 p m  under the Mirasdars and their wages shall be for men Re  0 4 0 per day and for women Re  0 2 0 per day  9   10   The above said communities should not use Indian Music  Melam  etc     marriages and other celebrations   M22CC  in their  \fAPPENDIX I   486  They must stop their habit of going on a horse in procession before tying the Tliali thread in Marriage  and they must use their house doors as a palanquin for the marriage processions and no vehicle should be used by them  for any purpose ” 1    It is not suggested that the eight or eleven injunctions of the KaUar would be taken very seriously by any one but themselves  but they are quoted here to indicate the attitude often adopted towards the exterior castes  Similarly in Bengal the use by a Namasudra bridegroom of a palanquin in a marriage procession led to a disturbance  and other instances could probably be quoted from other parts of India   Economically the exterior castes in  eastern India are generally speaking self supporting  and by no means desperately poor  In western India their position often is that of scavenger or village menial for whose service there is a certain amount of necessity which is recompensed by a traditional provision of certain village lands or by other methods of payment in kind  The trouble frequently is that the number of these menials has become superfluous and they none the less expect to be fed by the milage for unwanted services  and if they do not get so fed they steal the grain  no doubt regarding it as theirs by right  In southern India again the exterior castes are generally derived from various classes of cultivating serfs who until recently were tied to the soil  leather workers for  In northern India their economic position varies a good deal  since  instance in industrial towns find a ready livelihood  whereas the exterior  castes in the agricultural areas  where they can only obtain the worst land and the worst wells   are very often extremely poverty stricken   The origin of the position of the exterior castes is partly racial  partly religious and partly a matter of social custom  There can be little doubt that the idea of untouchability originates Reminiscences of such a taboo are still to be seen in Burma where gravedigging in taboo  is a profession involving a social stigma of a kind which will not permit of association with persons of other professions  A comparison of this custom with the position of those who dig graves for the hill tribes in the surrounding areas leaves little doubt but that the repulsion originates in the fear of some death infection  and the underlying idea is not that the person himself is polluted by unclean work but that his mere association with death may infect others with whom the grave digger comes into contact with the probability of dying  The treatment of washermen all over India as a depressed caste is almost certainly traceable to a similar taboo  the objection perhaps arising from an association with the menstrual clothes of women and consequently an infection which  in the first instance  is magical though it later comes to be regarded merely as a matter of personal cleanliness  The untouchability which has originated in taboo has undoubtedly been accentuated by differences of race and the racial antipathies which seem common to every branch of the human family and have An instance of this sort of thing may again be found in Burma  renrforced the magical taboo  which  as there is no caste in the Indian sense  is useful as providing examples of the process Here pagoda slaves  the status of whom is hereditary  are looked down of caste formation  upon by other classes  In general pagoda slaves have been recruited from non Burmese races  Large numbers of Arakanese  Talaings  Mampuris and Siamese have been settled in various parts of Burma by various conquering monarchs as slaves of different pagodas  This racial element is probably to be traced again in the prohibition of the wearing of ornaments by certain Thus in the Naga Hills in Assam in the Ao tribe one of the sub tribal groups  which is castes  apparently of different origin to the rest of the tribe  is not allowed to wear ivory on both arms  Similar restrictions are found in the Laccadive Islands  The same element probably appears in the practice of hvpergamy  and the first step which any section of an exterior caste takes in order to raise its social standing is to deny to other sections the right to marry its daughters though continuing for the time being to take wives from among them  Thus have the Haliva Kaibarttas severed themselves from the  Taliya Kaibarttas and established themselves as  a separate ca ste  no longer depressed  and even so a section of the Namasudras is now attempting Indeed as between different sections of the exterior castes prejudice is just to segregate itself  strong as between the interior castes and the exterior castes generally  The Mahars in Bombay have objected to sharing their counsels and conferences with Chamars  and Mahars and Chamars have unanimously spurned the Bhangi  Similarly in Madras Pallars have objected to being classed with Chakliswhom they regard as no less inferior to them than the Paraiyans though all alike are untouchables to a good caste Hindu  Religion of ourse with its apparatus of holy vessels  sacred animals and sacrosanct priests has also contributed to the creation of untouchability  and society in general by its natural dislike of certain unclean occupations and by its very proper antipathy to criminal professions has done much to depress and stereotype the position of the exterior castes   of the idea     In 1916 and again in 1920  the Government of India called for a report to the moral and material condition of the depressed classes and for proposals for their amelioration from aU The records of the consequent reports will be found under Proceedings local governments  India in the Home Department  Nos  130 Go^ ennnent the of 131 of

a Commissioner of Labour entrusted with the task of encouraging the education of the depressed classes and of looking after their economic interests  but many private societies have also been at work  Besides a number of Christian Missions  the Depressed Classes Union  the Poor School Society  the Social Service League  the Andhra Deena Seva Sangam  and the Depressed Classes Mission The Arcot Mission has started of Mangalore are some of the institutions working for this object  an agricultural school and Local Boards have also been spending money towards the same end  In addition to this much has been done by the Self Respect movement and the Depressed The actual steps taken by the Government of Madras have been  besides Classes Conference  the appointment of a Commissioner of Labour  the insistence on the right of admission of exterior castes in various vays   exterior caste pupils into all publicly managed schools  the refusal of grants in aid to privately managed schools which do not admit exterior caste pupils  the removal of publicly managed schools from places inaccessible to exterior castes  the opening of special schools and hostels for the exterior castes  the remission of their fees  and the provision of scholarships and of On the economic side the Government special facilities for the training of exterior caste teachers  of Madras has taken steps towards the provision of house sites for the relief of congestion and for purposes of freeing the exterior castes from oppression by their landlords  the organisation and running of co operative societies  the provdsion of drinking water by constructing new wells and repairing old  the provision of bm ial grounds and sanitary requirements for the exterior castes  the assignment of land for cultivation  both by reservation for and free assignment  to exterior castes of lands not classed as valuable  that is  lands not affected by irrigation projects  and by reservation for exterior castes of lands classed as valuable and assignment  to them on payment of market value in easy instalments  As a result of these measures some In 1920  there were 150 000 pupils of exterior castes in schools  progress has been made  in 1930  there were 230 000  Over 100 000 of these were in Christian Mission schools and many of the remainder in schools maintained by the societies mentioned above  Most of these schools are only primary schools  there being only about 2 700 pupils in educational Out of 230 000 institutions above the primary stage of whom about 50 only were in colleges  Of the 230 000 only 16 000  however  were reading in schools in 1930 about 7 500 were girls  reading in ordinary schools not reserved for exterior castes while over 70 000 pupils who did not belong to the exterior castes were reading in schools specially maintained for those castes  As compared with the rest of the population  while about 6 per cent  of the population of Madras was going to school when this census took place  only about 4 per cent  of the  and of that total less than 1 per cent  was beyond the primary been spent by the Madras Government during the past ten years in financing and organising co operative societies for the acquisition of land for house sites and for the granting of agricultural loans and for purposes of flood relief  rural credit and collective bargaining  In 1920  there were over 14 600 members of exterior castes in about 100 co operative societies as a result of the work done during the decade there are now about 2 000 such societies consisting mainly of exterior castes and during receuTr years new societies have been registered at the rate of over 100 a year  Over 55 000 house sites have been provided and some 3f 0 000 acres of land have been assigned to exterior caste cultivators  But at the time of this census there were still six districts in Madras untouched by the activities of the Comini ssioner of Tiabour  In Bombay apart from the work done by private institutions among which the Servants of India Society is very prominent  little has yet been done  A Committee was appointed by the Government of Bombay to enquire into the condition of the depressed castes and aboriginal tribes in the Presidency in November 1 928  As a result of the recommendations of that Committee an otiicer was appointed in 1931  charged with tlie duty of watching over the progress of and of upholding the rights of the backward classes  In addition to that a Resolution of the Government of Bombay directed the recruitment of members of the depressed classes in the police  It is perhaps signiflcant that the CommiGee found it necessary to include in their recommendations an addition to the Government Servants’ Conduct Rules framed with a view to enforcing police treatment of the depressed classes by the orficials of Government  In regard to the education of these classes in British India generally some information has already been given in Chapter IX  Many of the Indian States have also recognised the necessity for special measures for the uplift of exterior castes  in particular  Baroda  Cochin and Travancore while in Gwaiior and Jaipur action has been taken more particularly in regard to the criminal tribes of which there are considerable numbers in those States  In Jaipur areas of land have been allotted to the criminal tribes and special schools have been opened for the education of their children  and the same has been done in Gwalior   exterior castes were at school  stage   Economically very considerable sums have        The occasion of this census  coming as it did at a time when political reforms appeared imminent  complicated the already plentiful difficulties in the way of getting an exact return of ntunber of exterior castes  A number of conflicting forces were at work  as  apart from the natural desire of individuals of exterior castes to raise their own social status by making themselves out to be something other than they were recognised to be by their neighbours  a definite movement was set afoot by the Hindu Mahasabha for the return of all Hindus as Hindu simply  \f488  APPENDIX 1   with no qualifications of caste or sect   In 1928 the Hindu Mahasabha itself passed a resolution the so called untouchables had equal rights with other Hindus to study in schools  and to use wells and roads and temples  and the same resolution called on priests  barbers and washermen to afford their services to untouchables  At this census  declaring  that  however  political considerations probably overweighed all else and many efforts were made to induce untouchables to record themselves as Hindus and nothing else  The exterior castes themselves were  however  generally alive to the fact that their interests required their ‘  ’  numbers to be definitely known   at the same time they were not unconscious of the fact that it might be advantageous to them to represent as many castes as possible as being depressed in order to swell their numbers in importance  Consequently  while in the Punjab the All India Shradhanand Depressed Classes Mission was calling on the exterior castes to return themselves as Arya Hindus instead of  for instance  Achuts or Dalits  the exterior castes’ own leaders were calling on their followers to return themselves as Ad DJiarnii by religion and not Hindu at all and in  other provinces the associations of the exterior castes were representing as depressed castes which very doubtfully fall into that category and many of w hich have been excluded on scrutiny  Generally speaking  however  it is believed that the figures for the exterior classes obtained at this census have been accurate on the whole and the methods adopted in different provinces to determine what constitutes an exterior caste have already been referred to  while extracts from some of the Provincial Reports will be found below     ’  ‘  Litrle information exists as to the actual numbers of these exterior castes who are entitled Except in the case of Madras  to a vote under the present constitution of the provinces  nomination has been resorted to to secure the representation of depressed classes  Four  members have been so nominated in the Central Provinces  two each in Bombay and in Bihar and Orissa  one each in Bengal and in the United Provinces and none in the Punjab In Madras ten members were nominated to represent nine specified communities or in Assam  recorded as depressed  while individuals of the exterior castes were not debarred of from voting in a general constituency if they happened to be qualified as electors  It has been estimated that there are in Madras rather less than 57 000 exterior caste “ non Mahomedan ” voters  that is to say  about electors in a total of more than 1 J million some castes form exterior though the 16 per cent  of the total non Muslim population  per cent   4  In Bombav a rough estimate has been made that there are 15 600 e cterior caste voters out of a total of 759 000 voters in all the general constituencies  that is  about 2 per cent  of the exterior castes have votes  whereas they comprise over 8 per cent  of the population of the course  Presidency   The following Tables A and B will give some indication of the numerical constitution of the depressed castes and of their distribution and

and State Eeports on the the depressed classes   subject of     The treatment of the subject by the Census Superintendent of Assam has already been mentioned as typical of the method adopted in all provinces at this census  He wntes as  follows     \f   EXTERIOR CASTES   495     Assam  Under the orders of the Census Commissioner for India a list of depressed and backward classes has to be prepared for every province in India  The invidious task of preparing such a list for Assam has  therefore  been laid upon me and I am compelled  however reluctantly  to assume the functions of a modern Ballal Sen ‘‘Depressed” as used in India in connection with caste has come to be associated particularly with persons belonging to certain castes in Madras who are unapproachable  whose touch necessitates immediate purification and who are not allowed to read in the schools along with other boys   There is  I am glad  to  say  no such degree of dep e ssion in Assam an un approachable caste unknown here and boys of all castes are freely admitted into all  schools and colleges  Nor    is  are there any difficulties worth mentioning as regards the drawing of water by all castes from  public  ‘  tanks  ’  and wells   Hence I would be loath to apply to any caste in thi s province an adjective which has come to connote an extreme state of degradation  The expression “ depressed castes ” does however occur frequently in this note in the extracts quoted from the opinions of various ofiicers  This is merely because these opinions were received before I had decided that T w ould not use the term in Assam   The unusual expre ^sion “ Hindu Exterior Castes ” has been invented by me in accordance with the permission given by the Census Commissioner for India to Provincial  Superintendents to use any expression which they considered more suitable to local conditions than the liackneyed term “ depressed ”   To return to our three divisions “ Hindu Exterior Castes ”        This  as  I have confessed  is an expres sion to which 1 plead and it is open to many criticisms  I have however asked many Indian gentlemen to give me a bettor one but they have not succeeded  The expression  as it stands  connotes castes which are Hindu castes but which are outside    omething and that is really what I mean to imply   1   guilty   I  am hy no means proud of  What are they outside   Society     it  The ans ver is thajt  they are outside the social pale of Hindu that they are on the other  «ide of a barrier which  that they are “ below the salt ”     prevents them from moving upwards   But before going further I must define what I mean by ‘‘ Hindu Exterior Castes ”   By this expression I mean castes recognized definitely as Hindu castes whose water is not acceptable and who  in addition  are so deficient as castes in education  wealth and intluence or  for some reason connected with their traditional occupations  are so looked down upon that there seems little hope of their being allowed by Hindu Society to acquire any further social privileges within at any rate the next decade         By the use of the word “ exterior caste ” I certainly do not intend to imply that such a caste can never raise itself to a higher level  On the contrary I intend to imply that this can happen  as it actually has happened in the past  and that an exterior caste may in the course of time possibly become what I may call an “ interior ” one  It is impossible to lay down any simple tost to di stinguish members of the Hindu exterior  castes in Assam from others   The main test to distinguish “ clean ” ca stos from   unclean ”  A  castes is whether the water of the caste is accepted by members of the upper castes  caste whose water is acceptable is known in the Surma Valley as jalchol ” and a caste who se water  may be conveniently defined as “ jal achal ”  In Assam the words “ pani dude ” ” “ and pani na dale are in vogue  But we canuot apply thi s simple test alone in order to find is not accepted  out which castes are exterior and which are not  It is true tliat all exterior castes are jal achnl but it is not true that all jal achal castes are e xterior  For e xample in the Sylhet district the Shahas are technically a jal achal caste but they are a very wealthy and influential community who are treated with considerable respect in society and by a peculiar social convention are permitted to purchase their brides from the higher castes   The Shahas are in fact a good example of a caste which though technically unclean have by their own efforts raised themselves to a position in which the upper classes simply cannot afford to ignore them  I have not therefore classed the Shahas as an “ Exterior Caste”  One of my friendly critics  Babu K  C  Dutta  Extra Assistant Commissioner  has taken up this point   “ You do not class ” he writes “ the Shahas as an ext erior caste simply because of their  education and the wealth and influence they command  Yet they are not jal chal  they are not allowed entrance into the Thakurghar of the cleaner castes and the disability is not likely to he relaxed in the next decade  I do not concede for a moment that the disabilities that bar the Shahas are any more pronounced in the case of the less influential and uncultured castes  These exterior castes are suffering from want of education  wealth  culture  in fact  all that contributes to social influence  As soon as they have achieved these  their position will be ikin to ” that of the Shahas neither clean nor depre ssed      M22CC  \f      APPENDIX I   496  The Shahas are  of course  exterior to the extent that they fall on the other side of the great which divides Hindu Society ^the jal chal line but though this line is still of great importance other things must be taken into consideration      line     If  for example  the Patnis and Namasudras could shake off the tradition which associates them whh occupations regarded as low  most of them are now cultivators but tradition associates them with fishing and boat plying  and could acquire  as a caste  a reputation for wealth and culture they would  I admit  be in much the same position as the Shahas are to day   This process will  however  take many generations and in the mean ime they are  in  my  opinion  clearly suffering from greater disabilities than the Shahas  the disabilities being the very absence of those factors which have made the Shahas a respected c iste   it is  Thus while the jal chai line is a useful line of division between the upper and the lower castes not of much use as a test for determining the   Ex erior Castes”  Nor does the test of  temple entry afford us much assistance  ”  C renerally speaking in the Surma Valley all castes  which are    jal aohal are not allowed into the actual Thakurghar of temples in which the higher castes worship and are not allowed to Jal achal assist in the ceremonies bv bringing tulsi and flowers with which to decorate the idol  castes are however allowed “ darshan ” and are permitted to come into the compound of the temple  In the Assam Valley where the “ Nainghar ” generally takes the place of the temple the same principle holds good but a distincrion is made between different classes of jal achal Nadiyals and Banias for example are not allowed at all into the Na nghars of higher castes  castes whereas Katonis and Suts are allowed in some districts to enter the part not regarded as particularly holy  i e   they are not allowed to enter the Monikhut   The whole matter being  therefore  so indeterminate how  it may be asked  can I possibly venture to say  with any degree of certainty  whae castes are exterior  The only possible method was to find out by local enquiry in each district the general social position of all castes which might be thought to come under the definition of ” exterior castes ”  This is the method I adopted Caste in the Assam Valley is not  as elsewhere  chiefly a functional division     it is  really a  racial division and functional castes are very few   Probably for that reason Hinduism in that valley is tolerant towards the tribal communities which have not yet been completely absorbed into its organism  It must  in fact  be ejrtremely difficult for an Assamese Hindu to despise at heart a man whose Hinduism is open to considerable doubt but who considers that he is just as good a man as any  Koch or Kalita  In fact people like tlie Deoris cou ider that they are much better and don t care who knows it  Nobody can be depressed who hits you with a big stick if you attempt bo show your contempt for him   As a result the only caste s in the Assam Valley which can be called e xterior are castes which are either traditionally associated with some degrading occupation  such as selling fish  or whose About some castes in this valley there is traditional origin is associated with a bar sinister   however  no possible doubt   Let us deal with these first   There is  I consider  no doubt that in tlu‘ Assam Valley the caste which at this census has adopted the name of Bania and which at previous censuses was styled Brittial Bania is an borne of the leading men of this community have in fact informed me that exterior caste  their position in society is hopeless and have asked to be cla ssed as a depressed caste   That this caste is an exterior caste is also the unanimous opinion of all responsible oSicers whom I have consulted   Nor is there any doubt about the large class which has no v adopted the ca ste name of and which was   reviously known as Nadiyal nor about the Charals of Lower Assam who now call themselves Namasudras with their offshoot the Hiras  The general opinion Kaibartta        about all these castes is unanimous   Thus the Census Oilicer  Dhubri  reports     “ Namasudras or Nadiyals or Jaluas or Charals or Kaibarttas or Dorns are considered  untouchable by caste Hindus who neither admit them into their places of worship ” nor take water touched by them  and the Census Officer  Jorhat     “ Among the indigenous Assamese castes the following are depressed  1   Kaibarttas or Nadiyals or Dorns    2  Brittial Banias   3   Hiras or Charals  found in Lower Assam onlyl ”      \f   497  EXTEEIOR CASTES  From Darrang comes further evidence  “ That Dorns  Nadiyals  Namasudras  Charals  Hiras and Brittial Banias age depressed  is admitted  by the members of the community themselves who were consulted ”  writes the Census Officer   In fact in every district of the Assam Valley the opinion is unanimous that the BrittialBanias and the Kaibarttas  which name may be taken to include Charals  Nadiyals  Hiras and all the other names which from time to time have been appUed to various branches of this family  are the most exterior castes in the whole of the Assam Valley  These castes are socially “ outside the pale ” and though the Brittial Banias have worked hard to improve their position and have a considerable number of educated men amongst them they appear to be as far o3 as ever from any sort of social recognition  Ancient custom and practice have ordained that members of these castes are to be treated It is true that the former necessity of taking a bath if louched by a member of one of these castes has fallen into disuse but a Brahman officer of about 30 years of age has informed me that when he was a small boy he had to take a bath if  by accident  he was touched by one of the hated Dorns  as practically untouchable   Above these castes came others whose position seemed to me for a long time to be extremely They are the Naths or Jugis  known in Upper Assam as Katonis  and the Suts who are also commonly called Borias  doubtful   A careful study of the position of these castes has however convinced me that I would be wrong to class them as exterior  The truth about the Naths and the Suts appears to be that they are exterior castes who have made considerable efforts to raise themselves socially and that their efforts are beginning to bear fruit   There is a bar against them but they are beginning to break through it they are really “ superior exterior castes ” who are moving upwards  There is  in fact  hope for them  As one Assamese officer has briefly expressed it       “ AU Assamese low castes have a chanoe of rising in the social scale except the Dorns and  Haris whose case is hopeless ”  The Suts and Naths do not themselves desire to be classed as depressed or exterior and in fact strongly object to it  “ The Education Department in 1915 provided three general dining halls and four separate  rooms and the understanding has always been tha the upper caste boys are to dine in the general fining halls and the depressed or backward class boys are to use the above four rooms For the last two years  there has been a very strong movement for admitting these remaining backward caste boys into the general dining hall there is an overwhelming majority in their favour  only a small minority of about five or six still being in the opposition ” ‘  ’     Professor Sen Gupta has subsequently informed me that the movement referred to in the last paragraph of his note resulted in August 1931 in the abolition of the remaining restriction and        as a tentative measure permission was given to the students who had formerly dined in the four rooms set apart to dine in the general dining hall  The Professor thinks it probable that the concession will continue   that   This last piece of mformation  I confess  surprised me  If the concession is allowed to continue it will reflect great credit on the liberal spirit of Professor Sen Gupta’s mess and may  in time  have a far reaching effect on social custom in the Assam Valley  It does not  however  change my opinion that the Kaibarttas and Banias are definitely “ exterior castes ”   On the whole I feel fairly confident that my classification of exterior castes in the Assam Valley is correct I only wish I felt as confident about the exterior castes in the Surma Valley   Conditions in that Valley are very different from those in the Assam Valley  Sylhet is linguistically and ethnologically connected with Bengal and the inclusion of this large district in  Assam was originally merely a measure of administrative convenience  Sylhet and Cachar  which is largely populated by people of Sylhetti origin  are therefore  Hence there are many more functional castes than in the Assam Valley where  as I have already explained  caste is largely racial  Moreover  the presence of a large upper caste zamindar class in Sylhet the arbitrators of social usage has not tended to encourage any relaxation in the treatment of the lower orders of society essentially Bengali in their culture   Take for example the case of a M  A  of the Sylhet Mali caste occupying a good Government post   Many responable Hindu officers have informed me definitely that if such a person came alone to see them in their paternal homes a chai   would not be offered to the guest  A jol chauki  small wooden stool  might be offered  Even Mushms treat these low castes in the same way   A Muslim Sub divisional Officer tells me that if a Dhubi friend of his occupying a good position in Government service were to come to his house to see him ‘‘ I would not offer liim a chair  would simply say “ sit down ” and the Dhubi would not take a chair ”  M22CC  I  \f         APPENDIX I   498  Surely ii the upper caste Hindus wished to help the lower castes the least they might do is to treat the educated men among the lower castes with the same courtesy as they would extend to an educated Muslim   The following opinion of a responsible Hindu Government officer is of interest “ Some low men by their submissive attitude win the hearts of the upper caste men and get partial admission into society  Others claim as of right and get refused  A lot depends on the man    caste  If he claims too  himself   much he gets badly snubbed  In places where orthodoxy is strong he  In the towns treatment is more hberal than in the In the villages orthodoxy still prevails  If a Patni is the tenant of a Ze min dar he will never get fair social treatment however highly educated he is  Orthodoxy is strongest amongst the Zemindars  But if the low caste man is an executive ofiicer such as a Sub Deputy Collector or an Extra Assistant Co mmis sioner he would be given better treatment than a non executive officer  e ^   than a Deputy Inspector of Schools ’  The above remarks refer  of On all social and public occasions the educated Mah course  only to private social intercourse  or Patni is simply nowhere  He has  if he goes to the ceremony  to sit along with his other caste men outside the house on the mat provided for their caste  while the higher castes sit inside will not  in any case  get fair treatment   villages   the house   Add the following facts  1      Members of castes like Mali  Patni  Muchi  etc   temples set up by the higher castes  are not allowed to enter into the      2   The upper castes will not take water or food touched by them and one begins to reahze the dreadful sense of mingled inferiority and hatred which an educated member of one of these exterior castes must feel in most cases towards the higher    castes   The exterior castes themselves are  however  guilty of similar treatment to each other and an exterior caste which considers itself to be on a higher social level than another exterior caste adopts exactly the same attitude as the higher castes do towards the exterior castes  A case The local ferryman there which recently happened in Sunamganj illustrates this  point  His defence was  a Patni by caste  was prosecuted for refusing to row a Muchi across the river  that  according to social custom  a Patni could not row for a Muchi and that it has always been the practice  if a Muchi wanted to cross the river  for the paddle to be given to him so that he could row himself across  After careful consideration and analysis of the evidence I have collected  I have come to the conclusion that the following are the main castes in the Surma Valley which should be classed as They are arranged in alphabetical order exterior     1   Dhupi or Dhobi   6   Mahara   2   Dugla or Dholi   7   Mali  Bhuinmali    3   Jhalo and Malo   8   Namasudra   4   Yogi  Jugi   Nath    9   Patni   5   Kaibartta  Jalliya    10   Sutradhar   There is general consensus of evidence that these castes are exterior throughout the Surma Valley though the position of some of them seems to be much more hopeful in Cachar than it is I have no doubt that this is due largely to the absence of a Zemindari class in Cachar in Sylhet  district I have been told by several officers that the temporarily settled is a which Mai aras are a  jal chal caste and that people of this caste were made clean by some ancient Kaja of Sylhet the idea being that the Maharas used to carry the Kaja’s palanqmn and  as Eaja wanted to smoke in it  he had to have as palanquin bearers people who could attend to his smoking requirements  On the other hand some officers completely deny this story and say  the Maharas are principally to be found in South that the Maharas are not a jal chal caste  Sylhet  The Sub divisional Ofiicer  a Muslim  reported as follows ‘  ’              “ I have made close and careful enquiries and there is a general consensus of opinion that  the Maharas are not jal chal and are a depressed class  The story that Raja Subid Narayan made them jal chal for smoking requirements only  seems to be true  If the Maharas arc at all jal chal  they are jalchal only in the sense that a man of higher caste can smoke a AwAra filled with water by a Mahara  There is not a single graduate among the Maharas in this subdivision and not even a single matriculate can be found  The Deputy Inspector of Schools reports that the only educated Maharas he has met in the whole subdivision are three persons working as Vernacular teachers in Primary and Middle English Schools  So the Maharas are depressed both socially and educationally  \f            499  EXTERIOR CASTES One gentleman from Karimganj   himself a Nath has  indeed  no hesitation in including  his community among the exterior castes   “ So far as     He writes as follows     my knowledge goes  amongst the Hindus inhabiting this suh division the  Patnis  Jogis  Naths   Namasudras  Malis   Dhubis and Duglas are to be properly  included in the list of depressed classes  The reasons of each of these communities are almost the same  namely  depression regarding     of these communities are not allowed by the so called high caste Hindus  to enter the temple   even their shadow defiles the image in  The members   1   the temple   The high class Hindus never take any food and water touched or shadowed by these people  priests in ceremonies  3  Brahmins of caste Hiudus never agree to officiate as performed by these people even if they request them  barber who  4  Some of these communities are not allowed to have the same works amongst the high class Hindus to work for them    2   In conclusion I beg to say that these are but few amongst the many disadvantages from ” which these people suffer  Previous census reports show that for the last forty years the Naths have been endeavouring to raise their social position by giving up widow re marriage and refusing food prepared by other In spite  however  of these efforts the Nath community of the Surma Valley is still castes  very much looked down upon and I must  I consider  class them as an “ exterior caste ”   This classification may seem peculiar inasmuch as I have not classed the Naths  Katonis  How far the Assam Naths are connected with the Sylhet Naths is a matter into which I intend to enquire further but I doubt whether there is any very of the Assam Valley as exterior   In any case a sufficient explanation of this difference in treatment would close connection  appear to be that Hinduism in Sylhet is nob so tolerant as it is in the Assam Valley  Even in the Muraiichand College caste restrictions seem to be much more closely observed than in the Cotton College  I have recei  ed a note on the system of messing in that college and it appears that even the Sahas are not allowed to take their meals in the general dining hall reserved for the upper caste students  In fact the jal chal line is strictly obser  ed there at least nominally and the students who do not belong to the upper castes have their meals served to them “ either in their own rooms or in those set apart in the main block or in two out houses provided for thd  purpose ”      Of the Chuhras the Census Superintendent of Baluchistan writes

7 300 000 in round figures  or Ib^ per cent  of the population of that province  He goes on    “ For reasons already given this figure cannot be taken as an absolute tale of those to whom the peculiar disabilities summed up in the broad term depressed attach  There are many Christian converts on whom disabilities press no whit fighter than in the untouchable communities they owned before  These are not included  for personal and local and sectarian variations enter too largely for census allocation to be possible  There are other bodies the difficulties of whose fife are hardly less than those of any Adi Dravida but to whom the technical stigma of untouchabifity does not apply  Such do not figure in the census fist  The census total therefore can fairly be termed only an approximation  It is however a good approximation and  as an indication of the general dimensions of untouchabifity and through it of the depressed classes problem  is absolutely reliable  Whether its approximation is above or below would depend on the point from which approached  If this viewed primarily the existence of ‘  heavy social disabilities  M22CC  7 300 000 is a minimum  if it considers strict personal The general dimensions of seven millions are beyond contest   the figure  polluting power it is a maximum   ’  \f500  APPENDIX I   The 7 300 000 figures and the discussions above refer of course only to persons enumerated within the province on census night A third of the emigrants belong to the depressed classes and consequently  were the natural population to be considered  eight millions would have  to be taken as the round figure for them instead of seven  Only one of the communities represented shows an increase at all over the decade and for the Chakkiliyans the caste record seems full and as accurate as any census figures of caste can be expected to be  Apparently the Chakkiliyan is still content with the old name of his community  and is practically free from that seeking after new names which has  afflicted  the depressed  as a whole   His fellow leather worker of the north has not escaped the contagion for Madigas have d iminished apparently 16 per cent  More pronounced decline however is apparent in their hereditary enemies  the Malas  who have shed a million  while in the south the Paraiyans have dropped IJ millions and the Totis have practically disappeared the figures returned for the Adi family sufficiently account for the above phenomena  The Andhra section  the name seems to have taken on most in East Godavari   now two thirds million strong  had no returns in 1921 while that year could yield only 50 000 Adi Dravidas as against 1931 ’s 1 619 000  thirty  two times greater  The drift from the old names is nearly as marked on the West Coast  Holeyas were 92 000 in 1921  50 000 ten years later  They were 155 000 in 1891 and have declined steadily  The few himdred Adi Karnatakas do not come near bridging the gap and are in any case a Bellary and Coimbatore  not a Kanara production   It may be that the emergence of 23 000 Pulayans  a community not recorded from Malabar in  The words are identical  with merely the 1921  accounts for some of the missing Holeyas  characteristic substitution of a Kanarese ‘ h ’ for a Tamil or other ‘ p’ and it is difficult to see how Pulayans could have vanished in 1921 whep they are a well known feature of the region  On the other hand 98 per cent  of the Holeyas of 1921 returned languages other than Malayalam  which goes against the Pulayan theory  The presence of 16 000 Adi Dravidas in South Kanara clearly accounts for part of the 40 000 and it is interesting that his term should be preferred to Adi Karnataka  The preference is understandable when it is remembered that the Holeyas are essentially a Tulu  not a Kanarese  community and that while Adi Dravida does mean something it is extremely doubtful whether Adi Karnataka or for that matter  Adi Andhra  has any even theoretical justification at all   Even the Oriya depressed are not immune from the general decline  for Bavuris and Haddis Ghasis  Chachatis  Kodalos  Medaris and Barikis now  ^how a marked decline in numbers   appear in the records however in numbers considerably greater than the diminution in Bavuris and Haddis and their emergence is the explanation of the others’ decline  Other depressed classes of the Oriya region all show an increase  Dandasi  Eelli  Paidi  Pano  Dombo  etc   and the quest for euphemisms has not seriously begun in this area  an indication  as already remarked  of the much less acuteness which attends the whole depressed class question there  Conditions in fact reflect those of north India rather than south  The Dandasi community has of recent years made considerable efiorts at reform of its own customs and practices  with success it has not thought it necessary to discard its rather attractive and sonorous caste title but has wisely devoted its attention to contents rather than label     There is something infinitely pathetic in the vain idea that a change of name can reverse the stigma of centuries yet this community would apparently retort to Juliet that all lies in a name  It is a mistake to encourage terms which obscure real social units  That so ugly and clumsy a term as Adi Andhra should come to obliterate real and lively distinctions as Mala and Madiga is hardly to the good  Communities of such numerical importance and pronounced individuality should be encouraged to retain and develop a pride in their cognomens    It cannot be said that the social disabilities under which these communities labour are in sight of extinction despite the growth of tolerance and the inevitable effect of the development of communications and of urban life  Distinguished individual effort is bv no means  rare but it remains indmdual  Communities cannot yet be said even to have altered appreciably in outlook  I came across in a Telugu delta district a subordinate officer of the Labour Department  occupying the dak bungalow  an unusual thing for such officers  who ordinarilv put up with some casteman in the village  His castemen however shied off him  because of his employment  which brought him into constant association with the depressed classes  This man was of no notably exalted caste but a Telaga  It is probable that resentment at special consideration shown to the depressed classes in land assignment and other directions is reflected also in such an attitude  the resentment that the rising of the imder dog never fails to arouse in those who have kept him  down  a feature not peculiar to India   It remains however an indication of the true  position in  the rural areas where the depressed classes are most represented  A peculiar refinement of the untouchability theory was distance pollution  This set out The Kayatlis were the certain castes as polluting not merely on contact but by mere approach  back markers in this handicapping system and were practically denied ordinary use of public wavs  hen the system was in full force Kayadi progress must have borne a strong resemblance to that  M  whom  a warrant is out and whose one object is to avoid close contact with lus of a malefactor for so spent can hardly produce elevation of thought or desire and a lifetime fellow men   A  commirnity whose chief aspiration is to avoid notice cannot contribute much to national life   This  \fEXTERIOR CASTES   501  remarkable development of the superiority theory was practically confined to the West Coast and of late years has greatly weakened even there  probably more because of de elopment of communications and increase of population than from any conscious reahsation that there is in such a system something hardly compatible with claims to culture and advancement  It is probably becoming e^ddent that a person of such rare texture that a presence sixty feet away The pollutes him had better seek out some desert island or develop a less fragile purity  train began the breakdown of this preposterous system   the bus may complete it  Contact pollution on the other hand existed and exists all over the presidency   An instance of the modification and at the same time of the persistence of discrimination afforded by the river and canal ferries of the Telugu delta districts  According to petitions quoted in a Government Order of 1919 a member of the depressed classes might have to wait  is  for hours before being taken over as he and a Brahman would never be taken together and the  Brahman always had priority  In the bigger boats plying on the two rivers and larger canals there is now no such preference any person waiting is admitted on board  Depressed classes    however have to keep to a different end of the boat from Brahmans  In the cross river ferries the disappearance is not so complete and an influential Brahman would be taken over in In other cases either the Brahman or preference to a crowd of depressed classes of prior arrival  the depressed class person would hold back to avoid travelling with the other  The extent to which prejudice and preference have scope varies from village to village and with the importance It has been noticed that Christians of of the Brahman or enlightenment of the depressed  depressed class origin make no bones about getting into the boat whether a Brahman is waiting or not  The ferryman occasionally too has prejudices   On the small canal ferries Brahman precedence is still the general rule  but where the traffic considerable and the balakats big  as at Nidadavole before the bridge was budt  conditions resembled those on the river boats  is  The same petition complained that in certain municipalities depressed classes were denied the use of water taps reserved for higher castes  despite circumstances of proximity and convenience  Such restriction if it ever existed as an official practice no longer does  Despite their lowly status  these communities play a large and important part in the life presidency  It is they who furnish the backbone of agricultural labour in the chief ricegrowing districts  In one form or another the y have been the victims of an agre stic serfdom wherever they have been  This generally took  and still takes  the form of compulsory advances from their employers which could never be repaid in full and thus tied the borrower to the soil  This was most noticeable in Tanjore but a parallel system of advances produced the same effect in South Kanara  It must be laid to the credit of Ceylon and other estates that they have done more to raise the self respect of the South Indian depressed classes worker than any other single circximstance  It is possibly for the same reason that emigration is opposed in certain quarters  The Madras Government appointed an officer as Commissioner of Labour and among his particular functions are the attending to the needs of depressed classes  The decade has seen much expenditure on provision of wells for them  of schools  and a most important feature  the buying of house sites for them mainly in the delta areas  A notable example of a breakaway from caste traditions is in the Nambudri who was schoolmaster in a depressed classes school in Malabar  The Hayadi colony of Olavakkot formed to house members of possibly the most contemned community in Malabar has been able to develop its activities more than it anticipated  Recently however some difficulties have arisen through a boycott by other castes of of the  a school which received some Hayadi pupils ”  \f           •  APPENDIX U  Primitive Tribes   The jmrpose of this appendix is not to give an account of Primitive Tribes but their numbers and distribution  to indicate briefly certain  to  estimate  important considerations which bear on  their welfare and administration  and to point out where more detailed info rmation is available   Numbers   Since 1891 no serious attempt seems to have been made to arrive at the figure of Hill and Forest tribes  The figure given in Table XVII in 1891 was 15 806 914 but it was clearly in   complete  excluding as it did the Musahars  622 034 at that census  and others such as the Dublas and Talavias of Bombay and Baroda  172 052 in 1891   The Census Commissioner in 1921 roughly estimated the strength of hill and forest tribes at 16 million  page 226  Section 194 Census Report  1921   but his estimate was based apparently on the figures of major tribes of which a number are recorded in Section 87 of his Chapter IV  page 112   He does not mention tribes so important numerically as Bhumij  240 229 in 1921   Kol  328 425 in 1921   Bharia  630 862 in 1921   or Karen  1 220 356 in 1921   and as the percentage of the population laid down as cjualifying a caste or tribe to be separately tabulated must have ruled out of tabulation entirely a very large number of small units  he probably failed to realise the very large figure which is composed of broken and scattered tribes small and insignificant indiiudually  At this census special injunctions were given that all primitive tribes were to be tabulated whatever their numbers and irrespective of the percentage proviso for the individual tabulation It is therefore now possible to give accurate numbers of any identifiable tribal of castes  unit  though it is less easy to indicate the extent to which such a unit remains primitive in its habits   The basic figure indicating the total number of primitive tribes is to be obtiined from Table XVII by adding together the total figures of groups I  II and III  This figure amounts to 26 735 339  but some adjustments are necessary  These adjustments cannot be carried out with precision  as so many tribes  particularly in the Bhil  Koli  and Gond groups  fade off into castes wherever they live in the plains or open country as ordinary Hindu villagers  but if certain complete groups be deducted and others allowed to remain  since it is impossible to deal with broken units  and if no attempt made to include a certain number of nomadic tribes whose condition is doubtful and  if properly described as primitive  it is perhaps the result of degeneration rather than failure to rise  tribes such as Baujara  for ijistance  or Kaikadi  Yerukalas Pardhis or Sansis  vide Table XVII group XI  14   or the Koracha  Korama and Kuruba of Mysore where 12 333 persons have been returned as of tribal religion  apart from their 250 000 fellow tribesmen returned as Hindu   none of whom have been included in the figures here given of primitive tribes  then a reasonably accurate figure can be reached as representing the total population which can properly be described by the term primitive tribes  there will still be inevitably a slight overlap with the figures of the e xterior castes given in Appendix I  e g  in the case of Turi in Bihar and Orissa  ‘     Although this test has by no means been rigidly adhered to  the tribes given in Table XVII to primitive tribes enumerated in more than one province many other primitive tribes will be found in Table XVIII  but while some appear in both  others are likely to be found in neither table and reference for their details has to be made to provincial or state relate primarily  volumes   It is     consequently necessary

 1 00 204  must be deducted for the same    reason   This makes a total for deduction of 3 150 256 giving a remainder of 24  613 848 as the total population of primitive tribes in India 1931  It is unlikely that this total is understat ed and its tendency is obviously to decrease rather than increase with the lapse of time   Of this total number of 24  6 13 848 only 8 280 347 have been returned

primitive tribes in India may then be taken as 25 000 000 in round numbers  of which about 20 000 000 are in British India of whom again 2 500 000 are found in Burma  for there are in Burma a number of hill tribes who were only partially enumerated at the census  It has already been indicated that their position in surroundings of a more developed culture presents certain problems of administration  As long as a primitive tribe remains in isolation conducting its own affairs according to its own laws and customs it presents no problem except that required to prevent raiding of other forms of aggression on more civihsed or less warlike neighbours  For this purpose a mihtary occupation of territory may be necessary and a loose system of political control or administration of some sort which need not involve more than a minimum of interference with tribal customs and the expense of which  if greater  as it normally will be  than any revenue yielded by such an area  is in the nature of insurance  Where communications are meagre or non existent contact with the outer world v ill be so slow that the effect of its impact will not be rapid enough for observation and no change will take place in the primitive com munity except the gradual adaptation and alteration resulting from the intercourse on the fringes of the area inhabited  Changes of this kind involving a very slow change of environment and outlook are familiar enough in India and have been going on for centuries if not millennia  No serious problem arises until this process of slow adaptation is interfered with by a development of communication and a sudden increase of contacts   Even excise laws  although in many ways to the benefit of primitive  tribes   may operate  as a hardship  and would be found excessively severe if the very proper restrictions on distiUing  weie extended to pachwai and tari made for household consumption and forming a very important part of the diet of tribes that cannot grow sugar and are too poor to buy it  For three months in the hot weather the Marias of Chanda live almost exclusively on a very mildly Any one well alcoholic beverage  much as the Angami Naga does to a less degree in Assam  acquainted with either tribe will vividly realise the hardship that might be wrought by bigoted prohibitionists anxious to disallow to others that freedom which they do not value for themselves  and total prohibition is a policy shared by Hindus and Muslims  The prohibition of distilling itself may be a hardship  as for the Gond who must offer to his god liquor distilled by the family of worshippers  but this is probably one of those that must be borne in the interests of the community  like the game laws that prevent a Kachha Naga or a Kuki from offering game at tlie graves of the dead during the close season  or the troublesome restrictions on homicide which prevent a Wa from fertihzing his crop with the life essence of a stranger  or   the Koirdh from doing the same with the meriah he has reared for that purpose   The rapid operring up of communications  involving contact at many points and often the practical settlement of tribal country  entirely alters the aspect of any gradual changes that may have been taking place  Generally speaking it substitutes corrflict for contact  Not necessarily  that is  a co^ict of arms but of culture and of material interest   Attempts to  develop minerals  forests or land for intensive cultivation can only be made at the expense of the tribe whose isolation is thus invaded  The customs which regulate the owmership  usufruct or transfer of land among primitive tribes are generally at variance w ith those observed by more sophisticated communities  and in the conflict between the two the tribal custom is normally supersecied by a code v hich is neither valued nor understood by the tribe and in the application of V  hich the tribe is deprived of its property  generally in the name of law  either by alienation to foreigners or by transforming the trusteeship of a tribal chief into absolute ownership of a kind quite foreign to the customs of the tribe  This has befallen both the Mundas  for instance  and the hill tribes of Chittagong  to mention two instances only  while even in Eajputana a somewhat similar process has been at work  Here an authority thoroughly conversant with  \f   505  PRIMITIVE TRIBES   the people and conditions in that Agency states that during the last 25 years there has been a very marked change in the position of landlords from the chiefs downwards    “What  has happened in Rajputana in the last  century is a  complete departure from the   ancient relationship of peasant and chief  wherein the chief has become securely established in ‘ rights ’ that were not his a hundred years ago  and the peasant has been deprived both of rights and responsibilities  It  would not have been difficult to establish universal franchise a century ago as a matter of fact it was exercised  and is still exercised in inaccessible places  without being labelled  To day it would be so difficult as almost to seem an impossible task to make the peasant withdraw his watchful gaze from his landlord’s activities  just within the borders of the law  long enough to exercise an intelligent vote  let alone a responsible one In the century the operation of British law and its influence has set up the ruling chiefs in a security  authority the peasant has been and prestige that never appertained to their position in earlier times  and Progressively  and at an accelerated pace deprived of just so much as has accrued to the other since Lord Minto’s commencement of the policy of non interference  the common people have been deprived both of authority and responsibility  The British idea of law and application of it has made this process easy and apparently natural ”    A similar application of alien law  also usually disturbs the tribal customs of debt  Tribal customs of debt are frequently  perhaps normally  stated in terms of extravagant usury  Such terms however represent less the real customs observed in practice than the ideal which the lender considers ought to be the return  and in point of fact they are qualified by very important considerations  In the first place there is commonly no law of limitation  and the borrower may not expect to repay before the next generation while the lender is very often so placed that there is a moral compulsion to lend under certain circumstances even if no return is expected in his lifetime  Thus it is often the custom for a chief to lend paddy to the most indigent and improfitable of his  villagers in times of scarcity though he knows repayment to be extremely unlikely  In any case when repayment does take place there is normally a settlement by accommodation between both parties which bears little relation to the payment due on a strict interpretation of the law of usury as formally stated by the tribe  It is only natural that tribesmen whose views of debt are dictated by this sort of vague custom are perfectly ready to subscribe without demur to the most flagrantly usurious agreements exacted by foreign moneylenders who intend to invoke a foreign code to compel repayment on the letter of the agreement and at the time when it suits them to do so instead of at  such  law  of  time as the debtor finds himself in a position to pay  Similarly the criminal a civilized community is often entirely at variance with what is felt to be just and proper by tribal custom  Afforestation again is a frequent grievance  and in  forests which were common property under a tribal regime  it becomes a punishable offence an inalienable right  Thus under the Assam Forest Regulations tribal land used for jhuming is held to be Unclassed State Forest  and as such at the absolute disposal of Government  It can be taken and its possessors ousted without any sort of compensation  But this land has by the great majority of hill tribes been regarded for many generations as their most valuable real property  Further under a recent regulation it has been held that a man quarrying stone  for his own use  on his o’wn jhumlandis liable to pay Rs  10 per month or Rs  100 a year as a permit fee on the ground that the land from which he takes the stone is Unclassed State Forest  although it may have been the subject of bequest  mortgage  or transfer by sale and purchase for twenty generations  and its boundaries a matter of common knowledge in the village  Indeed a recent case occurred in which a young and inexperienced officer announced  on the strength of this Unclassed State Forest doctrine that he would recognize no indi vidual rights in jhum land  and even fined a man for letting land bought by his own grandfather to another man on lease  Such an action would in some tribes have been almost enough to cause a rebellion by itself but it was in no way inconsistent with the theory that the tribal land is unclassed State forest  In the Madras Agency Tracts again the same attitude has been taken towards there called podu  and has been carried to the extent of the prohibition of cultivation  twice bringing the Sawara tribe to the verge of open rebellion  Bahia  or bewar   as it is there called  is similarly forbidden in the Central Provinces  compelling the forest tribes to cultivate only under the land settlement system which is in many cases unsuited to them  Primitive systems of agriculture are frequently extremely wasteful of forest land and may in hill country prove damaging to adjoinina  plains on account of denudation  the too rapid escape of rain and consequent inundation below  At the same time wasteful cultivation of this kind is very often the only known means of subsistence  It cannot be abandoned in a day for other methods with  which the cultivator  whose knowledge is traditional  is unfamiliar  Again the exploitation of minerals not onlv involves the taking u p of tribal land but generally the introduction of an alien population  usually ot an extremely mixed character and not infrequently exceptionally dissolute  This im iinges on  to  exercise  what  the  tribe  regards  as     number of disconcerting ways  Even the invasion of missionaries is liable to produce as much evil as good  if not more  for their conduct and objects are generally in extreme conflict with tribal religion and with tabus of all kinds  and their point of view  readilv comprehensible to an alien administration which understands the tribal position verv vaguelv if at all  and backed as it so often is by influentially vocal societies at a distance  is much more likely to obtain the support of authority than tabus which are on the face of them unreasonable to all except those to whom they are the most vitally important things in life A similar misunderstanding of the tribal point of view is apt to arise in the case of many customs and it may be enough to mention that of marriage by a form of capture common to both Bhils tribal fife in a  \f     APPENDIX II   506  and Gonds  and  althougli quite familiar to the tribesmen themselves  often capable of being treated by British courts as cases of abduction  It is true that the law would normally require a complaint to move it to action  but it is obvious that a knowledge of the possibility of moving it is likely to encourage complaints from persons who would otherwise have acquiesced contentedly in tribal custom  and to result in a quite unjust punishment of the party complained against A Bhil was convicted for following a law really known to and admitted by the complainant  and sentenced by a British court just about the time of the 1931 census for just such a breach Apart from laws in themselves their of dealing with No apology is required for quoting at length antisocial actions or persons is entirely different  from Rai Bahadur Sarat Chandra Roy  himself a practising lawyer in Bihar and Orissa courts of the penal code in entire accordance with Bhil custom   manner of application may be extremely severe on people whose methods     “The British system of administration of justice  has unintentionally produced certain deplorable This complicated system of law and legal procedure  which is suited to advanced districts and people  was naturally not comprehended by the simple aborigines and was not suited to then level of culture  Although the judges and magistrates were inspired with a desire to do justice  very few of them were  or still are  conversant with the languages  customs and mentality of the people  And thus this complicated system of administration of justice has tendered to impair the natural truthfulness and honesty of the people in many cases  By repeated painful experience the people have found that under the complicated and cumbrous Procedure Codes and a too technical Law of Evidence which are now in force and which are beyond their comprehension  their native straight forwardness and veracity is no match for the chicanery and falsehood and the many subtle tricks employed against them by many of their adversaries  And “ law touts ” and other petty  fogging “ advisers ” are not wanting to induce them to adopt the ways of their adversaries  Such advice unhappily they now not unoften follow  though rather clumsily  But  as is inevitable  the expensive system of litigation through one court after another Courts of Original Jurisdiction  Courts of First Appeal and Courts of Second Appeal  is ruinous for the poor aboriginal  who  in most cases  cannot fight up to the last  and even those who can  only find themselves in the end utterly ruined through the expenses and trouble of securing ultimate victory  In this way the compheated British Indian system of adndnistration of justice has more often than not helped in ruining the aboriginals economically and in degrading them morally  effects on the moral character of the aborigines      The British system of law and administration has further tended to impair the social solidarity of the tribes and has weakened the authority of the social heads or Panches and the respect they formerly commanded  Until recently  when Government orders validating tribal customary law regarding succession and inheritance were promulgated  the Courts often disregarded the custom against inheritance by daughters and applied to them a Succession Act quite inconsistent with the fundamental social structures and ideas of kinship of the tribes  Until recently when rules against alienation of ancestral lands were promulgated by Government  the ancient tribal custom against such alienation was utterly disregarded  and through such alienation  alien Hindus and Mahomedans were admitted to the villages resulting in the further disintegration of the old village community  The recent restrictions against alienation have come so late  and the people have been now so long accustomed to such transfers  that a large section of the people now feel these restrictions irksome and no longer needed  and subterfuges are often resorted to in order to evade them ” Effects on the Aborigines of Chota Nagpur of their Contact with Western Civilisation Joum  Bihar and Orissa Research     Soc  1931   It is easy to see how a combination of anti tribal forces is likely to create  a condition of  excessive discomfort in tribal life  the most serious aspect of which is the complete of the communal organization   breakdown  A tribe living in comparative isolation will usually be found  have developed an adaptation to its environment which within certain limits approaches which may have taken many millennia to accomplish  and the breakdown of which may be the ruin of the tribe  for it is likely to proceed at a far greater rate than either the gradual change in physical environment or than the still slower process of to  perfection  an adaptation  adaptation to that change   In the past the administration of tribal areas as non regulation districts has in very many However uncomprehending and uncomprehended the administration may have been it was in a position to temper the conflict of interest  and to that position have been due precautions such as the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act  or such as exemption from the provisions of the Indian Succession Act or of the Stamp Act  or restrictions on the appearance of pleaders in courts hearing tribal cases  Even where such exemptions have been made they have often been too half hearted and too easily nulhfied  Of some 30 primitive tribes in the Central Provinces only 9 are specifically exempted from the operation of the Indian Succession Act  w hile in Assam a hillman who subscribes as he must do when in Government service  to the General Provident Fund cannot nominate as his heir his brother or his brother’s son according to his own venerated custom but if he has no issue must nominate his wife  This is reasonable no doubt to a Britisher  but is completely at variance with sentiment and custom in the Assam hills  and generally with good and sufficient Similarly the Post Ofiice Savings Bank recognizes Hindu and Muslim law but not tribal reason  custom  It seems more than likely that the incorporation of tribal areas into regulation areas  when such areas are governed by more or less democratic forms of government On the constitution of which the tribes will be placed in an insignificant minority  will bring their interests into direct conflict with the interests of their neighbours under conditions in which the administration of the tribal area will have very little power to modify the severity with which it will react on the tribes  Tribes occupying such an area reafize little or nothing of the method in which laws are administered outside it if they do they have no means of making themselves heard cases done much to make the position easier for the tribes affected      \f                     PRIMITIVE TRIBES   507  The consequence is that a few alien settlers who are able to do so and are wishful to live under the ordinary codes  which give tremendous advantages to traders and others dealing with simple and unlettered men  are likely to succeed  jt has imder existing conditions often been done  in getting a method of administration extended to a tribal area the disadvantages of which to the tribesmen are completely unappreciated by them until they find themselves irrevocably within its grip  In the process of accommodation it is only too likely that a previously nonhinduised hill tribe may become a mere depressed caste as has happened to the Turis  Koras and Kharias  to mention only three instances from the same part of India   while the cultivator is deprived of his rights in tribal land and degraded to that of a landless labourer  a process pointed out in the case of Gonds and kindred tribes by the Census Superintendent for the Central Provinces in Appendix III of his report   In the alternative they may retain a sort of emasculated tribal life  deprived of the customs it meaning and cohesion  and fall into that psychical apathy and physical decline which has decimated so many tribal communities in the Pacific and elsewhere and this decline is accelerated in another way by the opening up of communications  Many new diseases are imported against which no immunity has been evolved  since they did not form part of the environment to which the tribe is adapted  and the result is a staggering mortahty from which there may be no recovery  The rapidly approaching extinction of the tribes of Great Andaman has largely been due to diseases imported into the penal settlement and  and festivals that gave     communicated to the Andamanese by convicts  The use of distilled liquor  of opium and even of mercury  as a drug  is performing a similar disservice for other tribes and is likewise the result of the improved commimications which corrupt good manners  The Durbar of a State known to the writer vetoed the advent of rail communications on the ground that railways were an evil they only brought in dirt  disease  crime and strangers  and the state was better without  a judgement in which we may find very much indeed to commend        Meanwhile the difficulties under which primitive tribes are placed with regard to education have already been pointed out  vide paragraph 141 in Chapter IX   and in Bihar and Orissa a memorandum of the Government itself  submitted to the Statutory Commission  states that in the matter of education the aboriginals of that province “ as a whole are  relatively to the general population  in a worse position than they were in 1921  They have got a little less than their general share of the big advance made in primary education and decidedly less of the advance in high and middle education ”  Education in itself is a doubtful blessing in so far as it is apt to unfit them for their environment  but it is probably a necessary weapon of defence for them in the circumstances in which they are placed  perhaps the only one of any permanent value  though the real solution of the problem would appear to be to create self governing tribal areas with free power of self determination in regard to surrounding or adjacent provincial units  It remains to add a list of all papers in the 1931 census series which deal with primitive  tribes from one aspect or another
